# Contributing to District Scheduler

Thanks for considering a contribution! This guide covers getting the app building,
running, and tested locally. For *how the system fits together*, read
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first — it's the map.

District Scheduler is Distronode Corporation's Apache-2.0 fork of
[Calnode](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode). Most of the code is shared with
upstream, so the first question on any change is which of the two it belongs to.
There is a short section on that at the bottom, and
[SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) covers the same question for bug reports. Questions and ideas go
to [Discussions](https://github.com/distronode-corporation/district-scheduler/discussions),
not Issues.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.26+**; `go.mod` pins the 1.27.1 toolchain, which is what CI tests and both
  Dockerfiles build with (the SQLite build is pure-Go, so no CGO and no C toolchain)
- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** (the admin UI is SvelteKit; we use `pnpm`, not npm)
- **PostgreSQL 17** (what CI's `postgres` job runs), only if you are touching SQL or the
  tenancy model. See Tests.

## Layout

- `cmd/calnode/` — entry point + CLI tools (key recovery/rotation, admin reset)
- `internal/` — the backend (handlers, booking engine, calendar providers, slots,
  mailer, worker, crypto, db). This is where most changes live.
- `frontend/` — the SvelteKit admin SPA, embedded into the Go binary at compile time
- `internal/handler/templates/*.html` — the public, server-rendered booking pages
  (separate from the Svelte app — see ARCHITECTURE §2)
- `internal/db/migrations/` — goose SQL migrations, run automatically on startup

## Build

The frontend is embedded into the binary via `go:embed`, so a build is two steps —
the `Makefile` chains them:

```bash
make build      # pnpm build in frontend/, then go build -o calnode ./cmd/calnode
```

> **Gotcha:** restarting the Go server alone won't pick up frontend changes — the
> assets are baked in at compile time. After editing anything under `frontend/`,
> re-run `make build` (or `pnpm build` then rebuild Go).

## Run locally

Minimum env to boot (a dev box can omit the encryption key — see the caveat below):

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/calnode.db \
./calnode
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` → it redirects to `/admin/` and walks first-run setup
(create the owner, optionally connect a calendar, add an event type). Full env-var
reference and integration setup (Google/Microsoft OAuth, SMTP, Litestream) live in
[DEPLOY.md](../DEPLOY.md).

> Without `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` on a non-https `BASE_URL`, the vault uses an
> ephemeral per-process key, so encrypted data (OAuth tokens, SMTP password) won't
> survive a restart — fine for local dev. Production (https) hard-fails without it.

Multi-tenant mode needs PostgreSQL and two DSNs (`DATABASE_URL` and
`DATABASE_ADMIN_URL`) alongside `MULTI_TENANT`; it refuses to boot with either
missing. See [docs/MULTI_TENANT.md](../docs/MULTI_TENANT.md).

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...                       # backend — keep these green
cd frontend && pnpm test:visual     # real-browser computed-style checks
```

**This fork runs on two database engines, and a test run only ever exercises one.**
`internal/dbtest` returns in-memory SQLite unless `CALNODE_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is
set, in which case the same tests run against PostgreSQL and the `TestPostgres_*`
cases stop skipping. If your change touches SQL, a migration, a constraint error
path or anything tenancy-related, run both:

```bash
go test ./...                                    # SQLite
CALNODE_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN='postgres://postgres:pw@127.0.0.1:5432/calnode?sslmode=disable' \
  go test ./...                                  # PostgreSQL
```

A PostgreSQL run that reports no `TestPostgres_*` cases has not tested PostgreSQL:
the DSN was ignored or unreachable and the suite quietly fell back to skipping. CI
runs both as two jobs, `check` and `postgres`.

**Run `pnpm test:visual` after touching** `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/**`,
`frontend/src/app.css`, or the theme. shadcn-svelte styles state via Tailwind
`data-*` variants that need `@custom-variant` remaps in `app.css`; miss one and the
component renders **silently unstyled** (logic works, visuals don't). Unit tests
don't catch this class of bug — only the browser assertions do. See
`frontend/TESTING.md`.

## Migrations

Add a goose SQL file in `internal/db/migrations/` with the next number
(`000NN_short_name.sql`, `-- +goose Up` / `-- +goose Down`). They run on startup.
There are two dialect directories and the pair has to stay in step, which a parity
test enforces. SQLite can't easily drop columns, so `ADD COLUMN` is
reversible-by-convention only — prefer additive, nullable/defaulted columns.

## Translations

District Scheduler ships 9 locales (`en es fr fr-CA de it pt nl sv`) across the
booker-facing surfaces: booking page, manage/reschedule page, embed widget, the four
emails, and the calendar invite. The admin UI and the built-in video room are
English-only.

**Translation PRs are very welcome** - both new languages and corrections to existing
ones. **Every non-English locale is currently a machine draft with no native review**, so
if you speak one of them, fixes are genuinely valuable and will be merged readily. Small,
single-language PRs are easier to review than sweeping ones. Locale files are shared
with upstream unchanged, so a translation fix is the clearest example of a change that
should go upstream as well.

**Adding a language is adding one file:** `internal/i18n/locales/<code>.json`. No Go,
template, or frontend change is needed - `init()` globs the directory, and the language
switcher, the fallback-language setting and the public API payload all read
`SupportedLocales()`.

1. Copy `internal/i18n/locales/en.json` and translate the values. Keep every key, keep
   the key order (it keeps diffs readable), and keep printf verbs (`%s`, `%d`, `%q`)
   intact - reordering them is fine with indexed verbs (`%[2]s`), dropping them is not.
2. Name the file **BCP-47 canonical**: `pt-BR.json`, never `pt-br.json`.
3. `dow_short_*`, `month_short_*`, `date_format` and `clock_format` are data, not code -
   Go has no locale date tables. Match CLDR; the test below checks you against `Intl`.
4. Run `go test ./internal/i18n/`. Three guards will tell you exactly what is wrong:
   key parity, printf-verb parity (with `fmt` as the oracle), and a CLDR cross-check of
   the date tables (needs `node` on PATH; skipped if absent).
5. Eyeball the result: `go run ./cmd/calnode`, then
   `http://localhost:3000/book/<slug>?lang=<code>` and the manage page. Long words
   overflowing buttons is the usual surprise; check mobile width too.

Background and the full list of limitations (2-form plurals, no RTL) are in
[ARCHITECTURE.md §23](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Conventions

- **`gofmt`** all Go; standard library style. The codebase favours small, clear
  functions with comments that explain *why*, not *what*.
- **`pnpm` only**, and `pnpm exec <tool>` for local binaries (`pnpm dlx` has a
  Windows manifest bug).
- **Read [ARCHITECTURE.md §17](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** (cross-cutting gotchas) before
  editing — especially the SQLite single-connection rule (never query inside an open
  cursor), all-times-UTC, and "calendar side effects are best-effort."
- **Keep the docs honest.** If your change alters behaviour described in
  ARCHITECTURE.md, update the matching section in the same PR.
- **`calnode`-prefixed identifiers are compatibility surfaces, not oversights.** The
  module path, the binary name, the `CALNODE_*` variables, the `X-Calnode-*` headers,
  the `calnode_*` metric names and cookies, and the `<calnode-booking>` element are all
  wire contracts shared with upstream and with already-deployed instances. Renaming one
  breaks a customer's embed or an operator's dashboard. Don't.

## Branches and images

- **`district`** is the default branch and what you branch from. A push to it publishes
  `:edge` and `:sha-<short>`.
- **`dev`** is the pre-release lane. A push to it publishes `:dev` and `:sha-<short>`
  and deliberately moves neither `:edge` nor `:latest`, so a branch can be deployed to
  a real instance and exercised before it reaches the default branch.
- **`main`** is an old snapshot of upstream that is no longer kept in step; upstream is
  merged into `district` through a sync pull request instead. Don't open PRs against `main`.
- Pin a deployment to `:sha-<short>`, never to `:dev`, `:edge` or `:latest`. Those move
  under you and then nothing records which commit an instance is running. This fork
  itself ships by digest and cuts no release lines.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `district`.
2. `go test ./...` green (both engines if you touched SQL); `make build` succeeds; run
   `pnpm test:visual` if you touched UI/theme.
3. Keep the change focused; explain the *why* in the PR description.
4. Read the licence of contributions below; there is nothing to sign.

## Licence of contributions

By contributing you agree that your contribution is licensed under the Apache License 2.0,
as section 5 of the licence provides. There is no CLA and no sign-off requirement. You keep
the copyright to your work, and no bot will comment on your PR.

## Should this go upstream instead?

Most of this code is Calnode's, and a fix in shared code is worth more upstream than
here, because every deployment gets it rather than only ours. Rough test: if the change
would make sense on an instance that runs SQLite, single-tenant and no platform API,
it is upstream's.

- **Say so in the PR.** The template has a checkbox for it. That is all that is needed;
  you don't have to open the upstream PR yourself.
- **We do forward changes**, under our own name and crediting you, and we ask you first.
  Note that upstream **does** require a CLA, so if you would rather not sign one we
  simply keep the change here and say so.
- **Fork-only code is ours to fix**: multi-tenant mode, the platform API, row-level
  security, the PostgreSQL build and the `Dockerfile.district` image do not exist
  upstream. Send those here.
- If you would rather just open it upstream in the first place, please do. We track
  their releases and it will reach us.

The project's distributed code remains [Apache-2.0](../LICENSE). "Calnode" is upstream's
project name and mark (see [TRADEMARK.md](../TRADEMARK.md)), which is why this fork is
named and branded differently.
