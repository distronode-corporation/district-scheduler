# Multi-tenant mode

One process, many isolated workspaces. `MULTI_TENANT` unset behaves exactly as it always has:
SQLite and single-tenant PostgreSQL are unchanged, and every existing test passes without
modification. That is a gate, not an aspiration.

## What it is

A `workspaces` table is the tenant root. Every application table carries a `workspace_id`, and
**PostgreSQL row-level security — not the query author — is what keeps one workspace out of
another's rows.** A query that forgets its predicate returns nothing rather than everything.

The tenant of a request is resolved from the request `Host` (each workspace has its own public
hostname) or from the credential it carries (API key, session, OAuth token, manage token, invite,
magic link), and every route says which of the two it uses.

## What it requires

- **PostgreSQL.** SQLite has no row-level security, so there is nothing to express the isolation
  with. Startup refuses `MULTI_TENANT` without a `postgres://` DSN.
- **Two roles, two DSNs.**

  | variable | role | used for |
  |---|---|---|
  | `DATABASE_URL` | application: `NOBYPASSRLS`, owns no table in the schema | every request |
  | `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` | platform: schema owner, `BYPASSRLS` | migrations, RLS setup, cross-tenant reads, the worker's claim loop, the platform API |

  ⛔ **The two must not be the same role.** One role means the application owns the tables and
  every policy is inert against it — and nothing breaks: every request works, and it can also read
  every other workspace. That is the misconfiguration hardest to notice, so startup refuses it
  outright, along with an application role that is a superuser, has `BYPASSRLS`, or owns any table
  (`VerifyRoles`). The platform role is checked to genuinely bypass, because a platform role that
  does not silently does no background work at all.
- **Demo mode off.** Demo mode periodically wipes the database, which here is every tenant's data.
  The two are mutually exclusive and startup refuses both.

## Environment

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `MULTI_TENANT` | `1`, `true`, `t`, `yes` is NOT accepted: the value is parsed with `strconv.ParseBool`, and anything it rejects (`yes`, `on`) silently means off |
| `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` | the pair above |
| `CALNODE_PLATFORM_TOKEN` | bearer for `/v1/platform/*`. Unset ⇒ those routes 404 |
| `CALNODE_SSO_SHARED_SECRET` | HMAC key for the session hand-off. **Required** if Google or Microsoft login is configured: the callbacks hand off through it |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | networks whose forwarded headers are believed. Unset behind a proxy makes each workspace a single rate-limit bucket |
| `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | as before, and it must travel with any workspace moved between instances |
| `BASE_URL` | the identity host (below) |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | **ignored**; each workspace's `public_host` replaces it |
| `DATA_DIR` | where uploads (avatars, branding) are written; defaults to the relative `data`. A read-only image sets it to its mounted volume |
| `PLATFORM_RETURN_ORIGINS` | comma-separated origins the calendar OAuth round trip may return the browser to. Unset ⇒ off, and a `return_to` is **refused**, not ignored |
| `ADMIN_SPA` | `on` (default) or `off`. `off` stops serving the embedded admin console, so the platform's own dashboard is the only admin UI. Multi-tenant only |
| `METRICS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_FROM` | comma-separated CIDRs whose requests may scrape `GET /metrics` with no bearer. Empty ⇒ off, and the bearer is the only way in |

### `METRICS_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_FROM`

`GET /metrics` is bearer-gated on `METRICS_TOKEN` and answers **404** without it, which is
right for a publicly reachable endpoint and wrong for the one caller that has to read it.
A Prometheus collector cannot hold this kind of secret: Grafana Alloy's annotation
autodiscovery sends **one** bearer token file to every target it scrapes, so pointing it
at `METRICS_TOKEN` would present this instance's token to every other annotation-scraped
pod on the cluster. Measured consequence before this existed: the scrape 404'd about
**5,755 times a day** fleet-wide and the fork published no metrics in any region.

Set it to the networks the collector dials from and those requests are served without a
bearer. On a Kubernetes origin that is the **cluster's pod CIDR** — the value the
`district-scheduler` manifest passes is the pod network of the cluster the pod runs in
(k3s default `10.42.0.0/16`; the manifest is the manager's to set). Everything else about
the route is unchanged: the bearer still works, and outside these networks the answer is
the 404 it always was.

⛔ **Matched against the TCP peer, never a forwarded header** — not `X-Forwarded-For`, not
`CF-Connecting-IP`, and not the trusted-proxy-resolved client IP that
`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` produces for the rate limiter. Here the address *is* the credential,
so it has to be the one value in a request a client cannot choose; reading a header would
let anyone who can reach the endpoint claim to be the collector by asserting it. The rate
limiter can afford the opposite trade because the worst outcome of a forged value there is
a shared bucket.

⚠️ **So the endpoint must not be reachable THROUGH a proxy inside the allowed range**, or
every request arrives wearing that proxy's address. On this fleet the scrape is a pod
dialling the pod IP on `:3000` directly, and public traffic reaches the booking hosts
through Caddy on the node, which is a different path.

An unparseable entry is logged and dropped rather than fatal, following
`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`: the consequence is that that network cannot scrape anonymously,
which is the safe direction. The boot log names the list when it is in use, so "why is
`/metrics` answering without a token" is readable without reading the environment.

### `ADMIN_SPA`

A platform whose own console already has every admin surface does not want a second,
parallel one on each tenant host. `ADMIN_SPA=off` answers **404** on `GET /admin`,
`GET /admin/` and every path under it. Nothing else moves: `/favicon.ico`, the public
booking pages, the embed widget, the LiveKit room and the whole `/v1` tree are untouched,
and the routes stay **registered** — the 404 is served through the same middleware chain
as every other response, so request ids, logging and the security headers are unchanged.

⚠️ **The bare root is the exception, and it changed in M9.** `GET /{$}` used to redirect
to `/admin/`, so with the console off it was a bare 404 — on a tenant's own public host,
where a 404 says "no such path" and what is true is "the console that used to be here is
gone". Trimming a booking link back to the domain is a thing people do, and it read as a
broken host. The root now serves a **neutral index**: the workspace's public, active event
types, each linking to `/book/<slug>`, on the booking pages' own stylesheet and branding,
translated through the same plumbing, `noindex`, under the strict public CSP. A workspace
with nothing public gets the same page and one sentence — an empty workspace is not a
missing one, and the unknown-host 404 (which still fires, in `Scoped`, before the handler
runs) already carries that other answer. It lists nothing the booking pages do not already
publish to the same audience: no host names, no descriptions, no counts.

⛔ **No route was added or removed.** `GET /{$}` is the same registration; only the handler
behind it changes, and the classification totals still read **184 routes — 30 host-scoped,
108 credential-scoped, 38 platform, 8 allowlisted**. With the console **on**, in either
mode, the root is the redirect to `/admin/` it has always been, and a single-tenant
instance never reaches the index at all because `ADMIN_SPA=off` is ignored there.

Values are `on` and `off` only. `true`/`false` are refused at boot, along with anything
else that is neither: the fallback is `on`, so a value nobody can read exactly would
serve the console the operator wrote the variable to remove.

⛔ **It is ignored on a single-tenant instance**, which has no other admin UI — a
self-hoster would be locked out of their own installation. A stray `ADMIN_SPA=off`
there is a startup warning saying it did nothing, not a refusal.

⛔ **With the console off, an SSO hand-off needs an explicit `next` OUTSIDE `/admin`.**
The default destination is `/admin/`, which now 404s, so a hand-off without one answers
404 **before minting the session** rather than seating a session and landing the person
on a dead end — the token is single-use, so a redirect into a 404 could not even be
retried. The calendar connect round trip
(`?next=/v1/calendar/connect?provider=…&return_to=…`) is unaffected, and so is any other
explicit `next` that lands outside the console.

⛔ **An explicit `next` under `/admin` is refused too, and this said the opposite until
F6.** The old rule — "the caller said where to land" — read as deference and was a
bypass: native clients send `next=/admin/` on every hand-off, so with the console off the
guard fired for nobody, and the person got the exact failure it exists to prevent one
step later, with the token spent and the session already seated. The comparison is on the
normalised path (percent-decoded, `..` resolved, case-sensitive because `ServeMux`
matches bytes), so `/%61dmin/` is refused and `/admin/../book/x` is allowed — it lands
outside the console, which is what the browser would do with it too.

### `PLATFORM_RETURN_ORIGINS`

A platform that has replaced the admin SPA with its own pages still sends the person through
this instance for a calendar connection, because the OAuth redirect needs the session cookie
that lives here. Without this setting the callback finishes on `/admin/calendar`, which is a
page that platform no longer shows. Set it to the console's own origins
(`https://console.example.com,https://console.eu.example.com`) and
`GET /v1/calendar/connect?provider=…&return_to=…` will finish the round trip there instead,
with `?calendar=connected` or `?calendar=error&reason=…`. Each entry is `scheme://host[:port]`
with no path, query or fragment, `https` unless the host is `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, and a
malformed one is fatal at boot rather than a silently dead allowlist.

The security rule is that the destination is only ever a value that came **out of the
encrypted OAuth state**. `return_to` is checked against this list at connect time, by an
authenticated request, and then carried inside the state the provider hands back; the callback
never reads it from its own URL. The match is the whole origin compared byte for byte — a
prefix match would accept `https://console.example.com.evil.test`, and an open redirect out of
an OAuth callback is a better prize than most bugs in a scheduler. With the list empty, a
`return_to` is a 400 rather than a no-op, so a platform pointed at an instance nobody
configured for it finds out on the first attempt instead of on the landing page.

## The isolation model

Three layers, and each catches what the others cannot.

1. **Row-level security.** Every tenant table has `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and one policy
   comparing `workspace_id` to `current_setting('app.workspace_id', true)`. An unset or empty
   setting matches no row, so an unbound statement is silently empty rather than silently global.
   ⚠️ `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is deliberately **not** used: it would apply the policy to the
   table owner too, and in single-tenant mode the ordinary DSN *is* the owner — every existing
   deployment whose DSN is not a superuser would go blind. `ENABLE` alone already isolates a
   non-owner role, which is what the application role is.
2. **Per-statement binding.** A handle from `OpenPair` carries a workspace. Before each statement
   it takes a pooled connection, runs `SELECT set_config('app.workspace_id', $1, false)`, runs the
   statement there, and releases the connection when the statement finishes. Nothing is pinned
   between statements, so a handle is safe to copy into a goroutine that outlives its request.
   ⛔ `Prepare` is refused on a bound handle: a prepared statement is re-prepared on whatever
   connection the pool hands it, which would run unbound — silently empty rather than an error.
3. **Explicit predicates where there is no policy.** Four tables are exempt because they are not
   per tenant: `workspaces`, `crypto_keystore`, `goose_db_version`, `oauth_clients`, plus
   `sso_nonces` (a token id is global — the question "has this token been spent" must not depend on
   which workspace it names). Anything reading those, and everything on the platform handle, names
   its own `workspace_id` in every statement, because there is no policy behind it.

### The platform handle, and the one rule about it

The platform handle bypasses the policies. Two consequences that have each caused a real bug here:

- ⛔ **Every INSERT through it must name `workspace_id`.** It binds the empty string, so an unnamed
  column resolves to `''` and the row fails its foreign key. A route that writes on the platform
  handle and omits the column does not silently misfile the row — it fails — but it fails at the
  database, far from the omission.
- ⛔ **A tenant-scoped handle must be derived from the APPLICATION handle, never from the platform
  one.** Binding a workspace onto a bypassing role produces a handle that *names* a tenant without
  being *confined* to it: `WHERE id = 1` then matches every workspace's row and returns an
  arbitrary one. Reads are the failure mode, and they are silent.

### Reads that must not be bound

**A read whose job is to discover the tenant cannot be bound to it.** Credential lookups —
`api_keys`, `sessions`, OAuth bearer tokens — run on the platform handle and select the user's
`workspace_id` alongside. This is why those uniques stay global while `users(workspace_id, email)`,
`event_types(workspace_id, slug)` and `teams(workspace_id, slug)` become composite.

## Route classification

Every registration declares its class, and a source-scanning test fails on one that does not:

| class | tenant from | examples |
|---|---|---|
| host-scoped | `Host` → `workspaces.public_host` | the booking pages, public event-type reads, `POST /v1/bookings`, `/manage/{token}`, `/admin/*` |
| credential-scoped | the verified caller | the whole authenticated API |
| platform | nothing, on purpose | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version`, `/metrics`, `/.well-known/*`, `/oauth/*`, `/mcp`, `/v1/platform/*`, the OAuth login callbacks, the vendor webhooks |

An unrecognised host is a **404**, never a fallback to a default tenant: falling back would serve
one tenant's booking page on any domain pointed at the instance. A credential that resolves
workspace A on workspace B's host is **403 `{"error":"workspace mismatch"}`**. A suspended
workspace answers **503** with `Retry-After` on its public and admin surfaces.

## What a tenant credential cannot do

Every route below is an ordinary credential route that a workspace admin's session or
`cno_` API key reaches. In **single-tenant mode nothing here applies**: the operator is the
instance, and these are the only surfaces they have to configure it with. In multi-tenant
mode the platform owns each of them, and the refusal lives in the fork rather than only in
the platform's own console — because a workspace admin can mint a raw API key for
themselves and call the fork directly, so a console-side allowlist protects the console and
not the instance.

| surface | multi-tenant answer |
|---|---|
| `GET`/`PATCH /v1/settings/{email,google,zoom,livekit,stripe}`, `POST /v1/settings/email/test` | **403** `{"error":"managed_by_platform"}` |
| `POST /v1/settings/llm/test` | **403** `{"error":"managed_by_platform"}` |
| `PATCH /v1/settings/llm` naming `endpoint`, `model` or `api_key` | **403** `{"error":"managed_by_platform"}`; `enabled` and `extra_instructions` are the tenant's and are unaffected |
| `GET /v1/settings/llm` | answers without `endpoint`, `model` or `api_key_set`; `enabled`, `configured`, `active` and `extra_instructions` stay |
| `PATCH /v1/settings/notetaker` naming `stt_api_key` | **403** `{"error":"managed_by_platform"}`; the `enabled` toggle is the tenant's and is unaffected |
| `GET /v1/settings/notetaker` | answers without `stt_api_key_set` or `stt_base_url`; `enabled` stays |
| `PATCH /v1/settings/tracking` with a non-empty `head_html` | **400** `{"error":"managed_by_platform"}`; the GA4/GTM id fields stay |
| `POST /v1/webhooks` with an `http://` URL | **400**; https only |
| `POST /v1/calendar/caldav/connect` with an `http://` `server_url` | **400**, naming the field and the accepted scheme |
| `POST /v1/calendar/caldav/connect` to a private, loopback, link-local or metadata address | the ordinary "could not reach the CalDAV server", with no address in it |
| `PATCH /v1/event-types/{slug}` changing `slug` | **409** `{"error":"renaming an event type's booking link is not available on this deployment"}`, booked or not; resubmitting the current slug is the no-op it always was, and every other field is the tenant's |

The reasoning, per row:

- **The five credential pages configure the PROCESS, not the workspace.** `server_settings`
  is per workspace, so they look self-scoped; what each one names is not. The SMTP account
  every tenancy sends through, the OAuth client every tenancy's calendar connect and login
  uses, the Zoom app, the LiveKit server, the Stripe account. `PatchGoogleSettings` made
  that concrete: it hot-reloaded `calendar.Service` and the Google OAuth config on the
  process, so one workspace's PATCH re-pointed every other workspace's calendar and login
  until the next restart. That hot reload is now skipped entirely in this mode, as a second
  guard behind the 403 — the row is still written and still applies to that workspace.
- **The LLM split is by field because the page is.** `enabled` and `extra_instructions` are
  the workspace's own summariser settings; `endpoint`, `model` and `api_key` name the model
  provider the platform pays for. An empty `api_key` is refused too: `""` is how the handler
  spells "keep the stored one", so a tenant that can send the field can clear the
  instance's. ⛔ **`POST /v1/settings/llm/test` is blanket-refused rather than split**, and
  it is the sharpest route in the set: it dials whatever `endpoint` the body names, and an
  empty `api_key` makes it read the STORED key and dial with it — a request to a
  tenant-chosen host, carrying the platform's credential. With the PATCH's fields managed
  there is nothing left here for a tenant to test.
- **The notetaker splits the same way.** `stt_api_key` is written to the singleton
  `server_settings` row, so a tenant-supplied speech-to-text credential is what every OTHER
  tenancy on the deployment would then transcribe through; the `enabled` toggle beside it is
  the workspace's own and is the only thing the console offers on that page, which is why
  refusing the route was not an option. ⚠️ The GET drops `stt_base_url` as well as the key
  flag, and the URL is the less obvious of the two: `sttBaseURL()` answers the workspace's
  own value when it has one and the process value otherwise, and the response cannot say
  which — so a workspace that never set one read the instance's vendor host back as if it
  were its own.
- **`head_html` is refused AND ignored.** It injects raw HTML into the `<head>` of the
  workspace's booking pages and relaxes that page's CSP to fit it — on the operator's
  domain, on a page that collects card details. A row that already holds one stops
  rendering at read time, so a value written before this shipped (or restored by an import)
  needs nobody to save the page.
- **Webhook URLs must be https.** A booking payload carries the attendee's name, email
  address and intake answers. A self-hoster posting to their own machine over plaintext is
  their own data on their own network; a tenant's URL sends the operator's customers'
  details off the operator's network.
- **CalDAV requires https, and resolves through the strict guard.** Two separate checks
  answering two separate questions: whether the credential travels in clear, and which
  addresses may be reached. CalDAV authenticates with HTTP Basic, so the app-specific
  password is on the wire in every request — over `http://` to a permitted public host that
  is a disclosure the address guard has no opinion about, so the connect form takes only
  https here (single-tenant keeps `http`, where it is the operator's own password on their
  own network). The scheme check runs BEFORE the dial; run after, it would be a nicer error
  message on a password already sent. `server_url` is a bring-your-own-server
  field, so single-tenant keeps the narrow metadata-only block: a Nextcloud or Radicale on
  the operator's LAN is the intended configuration. Here the string is a tenant's and the
  private network it reaches is the operator's — the pod network, the node's exporters, the
  media plane — so every dial and every redirect hop goes through `netutil.ResolveSafe`, the
  guard webhook delivery already uses. ⛔ The error text is part of the fix: connect-success
  versus connect-failure, times a hostname the caller controls, is a port scan, so a refused
  dial produces the same sentence an unreachable server produces and names no address.
- **A booking link is never renamed.** Upstream lets an event type's slug change until its
  first booking, because a booking is the first evidence the URL reached anyone. Here the
  platform is that evidence from the moment the event type exists: it addresses each
  tenant's event types by slug and builds booking URLs from them (the voice agent books
  `phone-consultation` by name), so a rename breaks booking with no booking row to have
  warned about it. ⚠️ The refusal is on a CHANGE, not on the field: the embedded editor
  submits every field on every save, so the current slug (or a spelling slugify maps onto
  it) is accepted and ignored. The admin SPA still shows the field, because nothing it
  already fetches tells it which mode it is in; the server's answer is the guard.

⛔ **Everything NOT on that list is deliberately reachable, and it is what the platform's own
console calls**: branding, the storage toggle, the notetaker toggle, the tracking ids, the
two LLM fields, and every `/v1/{event-types,bookings,users,teams,availability-*,webhooks,
api-keys,calendar,recordings}` route. Guarding one of them would break the console in
multi-tenant mode only, which is the mode nobody runs locally.
`internal/server/routes_platform_managed_test.go` reads `server.go` and asserts both
directions, and fails on a `/v1/settings` route that is in neither table.

### Rate-limit buckets

⛔ **In multi-tenant mode an authenticated request keys on its CREDENTIAL, not on its
address.** The bucket is `(workspace host, caller)`, where the caller is a SHA-256 prefix of
the `X-API-Key` header, the `Authorization: Bearer` value or the session cookie — whichever
the request carries, in `RequireAuth`'s own precedence — and the resolved client IP when it
carries none.

The address is the right identity for an anonymous booker and the wrong one for an API
caller. A platform reaches every tenant host from a small number of egress addresses, so
keyed on the address alone an entire region's authenticated traffic to one tenant shared a
single 20-per-minute budget, and the busiest caller spent it on everyone else. That is the
failure the `(workspace, IP)` pair was introduced to prevent, one dimension over.

The credential is hashed and read straight off the request: the limiter runs **before**
`RequireAuth`, so it must not do a database read to decide whether to reject, and a raw
bearer must not sit in a map key that outlives the request. It keys on what was
**presented**, not on the user it resolves to, so an invalid key gets its own bucket rather
than falling in with the anonymous ones. Single-tenant is unchanged: the client IP alone.

## The platform API

Identity host, `Authorization: Bearer $CALNODE_PLATFORM_TOKEN`, constant-time compare. With the
token unset — or on a single-tenant instance — every route **404s**, so a prober cannot tell a
control plane from an instance that has none. A wrong token is 401.

### `POST /v1/platform/workspaces` → 201

```json
{
  "id": "acme", "slug": "acme", "public_host": "book.acme.example", "region": "us",
  "owner_email": "owner@acme.example", "owner_name": "Owner", "owner_timezone": "America/Toronto",
  "defaults": {
    "embed_allowed_origins": ["https://acme.example"],
    "webhook": { "url": "https://hooks.acme.example/in", "secret": "<optional hex>",
                 "fields": ["booking_id", "start_at"] },
    "event_type": { "slug": "intro", "name": "Intro call", "duration_minutes": 30,
                    "min_notice_minutes": 60, "max_future_days": 60,
                    "availability": [{ "day_of_week": 1, "start_time": "09:00", "end_time": "17:00" }] },
    "livekit_url": "...", "livekit_api_key": "...", "livekit_api_secret": "...",
    "stt_base_url": "...",
    "smtp": { "host": "...", "port": "587", "user": "...", "pass": "...",
              "tls": true, "starttls": false, "from": "...", "from_name": "..." },
    "llm": { "endpoint": "...", "model": "...", "api_key": "...", "enabled": true,
             "extra_instructions": "..." }
  }
}
```

Response: `{"api_key": "cno_…", "webhook_secret": "…"}` — **shown once**. One transaction creates
the workspace row, its `server_settings` row (`id = 1` per workspace, so existing `WHERE id = 1`
reads need no change), the owner (with `iana_timezone = owner_timezone`, because availability is
local `HH:MM` and defaulting the zone would move the workspace's hours), the first API key, the
webhook subscribed to **every** event the codebase emits, the default event type, and the owner's
working hours. Either the tenant exists complete or it does not exist.

⛔ **`defaults.event_type.availability` becomes the OWNER's working hours, not the event type's.**
The rules are written as global rules (`event_type_id` NULL) belonging to the owner, despite where
the field sits in the body; the name is the website client's and is kept. Slot generation offers
the union of a host's global rules and the event type's own, and the District dashboard's Working
Hours editor (and its overview) reads and writes global rules only, with no surface for
per-event-type hours. Seeded against the event type, the defaults stacked invisibly under whatever
the owner set there and could not be removed from it: a tenant that set 09:00-13:00 kept selling
afternoons. The owner is created in the same transaction, so there are never existing global rules
for these to collide with.

`defaults.embed_allowed_origins` and `defaults.stt_base_url` are per workspace and are READ: the public
booking endpoints' CORS allowlist is the one stored for the workspace whose host the request names (an
empty list means any origin, and a host no workspace owns gets no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` at all,
never `*`), and the notetaker sends that workspace's recordings to its own speech-to-text host, falling
through to `STT_BASE_URL` and then the provider default when the column is empty. In this mode
`EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is not consulted.

`day_of_week` is 0 = Sunday. A duplicate `id`, `slug` or `public_host` is 409, and the losing
attempt leaves nothing behind.

### The rest

| route | notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/platform/workspaces/{id}` | the row: `id, slug, public_host, region, status, created_at, updated_at` |
| `PATCH …/{id}` | `public_host`, `status` (`active`\|`suspended`), `slug`. Nothing else: the id is referenced by every tenant row and the region is where the data physically is |
| `DELETE …/{id}` | cascades every tenant table; responds `{"recording_object_keys": [...]}` because objects in storage cannot cascade and deleting them is the caller's job |
| `POST …/{id}/export` | one JSON document, tables in replay order |
| `POST …/{id}/import` | 409 unless the workspace is empty |
| `DELETE …/{id}/attendees?email=` | erasure, counts per table |

### The member API

The identity provider — not this instance's credential routes — owns who is in a workspace
and what they may do there. Each of its people acts here as their own user, holding a
platform-minted key, so a booking, a log line and an API call all name a person rather than
a shared service account.

#### `POST …/{id}/users` → 200

```json
{ "email": "ada@acme.example", "name": "Ada Lovelace", "role": "admin", "timezone": "America/Toronto" }
```

Response: `{"id": "...", "email": "ada@acme.example", "name": "Ada Lovelace", "role": "admin", "created": true}`.

An upsert on `(workspace_id, email)`. The address is lower-cased and trimmed; an empty or
malformed address, an empty name, a role outside `owner|admin|member`, or a `timezone` that
is not an IANA name is **400**. `timezone` is optional.

On an existing user: `name` is overwritten, the role is applied, and `archived_at` is
cleared — an upsert is the statement "this person is in this workspace", so a returning
member comes back. `iana_timezone` is written **only when `timezone` was sent**, because a
zone is something a person sets in their own profile and a sync that omits it must not
reset it. `email_login` is never touched: whether somebody may sign in with a password is a
fact about this instance's login, not about the directory.

⛔ **`role: "owner"` is a TRANSFER.** The same transaction sets `is_owner = 0` on every
other user of the workspace, so exactly one owner exists before and after — the invariant
the workspace's own `POST /v1/users/{id}/transfer-ownership` maintains holds here too.

⛔ **Demoting the only owner is refused: 409 `{"error":"owner_demotion_requires_transfer"}`,
and nothing changes.** Obeying it would leave a workspace with no owner, which nothing on
the instance can repair, because every route that grants ownership requires an owner to
call it. Upsert the new owner with `role: "owner"` first — that demotes the incumbent — and
re-send the demotion if it is still wanted.

#### `POST …/{id}/users/{uid}/api-keys` → 201

Body `{"name": "console"}` (1–64 characters). Response
`{"id": "...", "name": "console", "api_key": "cno_…"}` — the plaintext is **shown once**.
The key is **managed** (below). **404** when the user is not that workspace's, or is
archived.

⛔ **A mint with a name the user already has ROTATES.** The earlier *managed* key of that
name is deleted in the same transaction, so a caller that lost a key and re-mints never
accumulates credentials, and the old key stops working at the instant the new one starts.
Two live keys therefore need two names. A key the person minted for themselves under the
same name is theirs and is left alone.

#### `DELETE …/{id}/users/{uid}/api-keys/{keyId}` → 204

Managed or not. **404** when the key is not that user's in that workspace, so the route
cannot be used to learn which key ids exist elsewhere.

#### `POST …/{id}/users/{uid}/archive` → 200 `{"archived": true}`

The offboarding path, with the platform as actor: it is not a member, so the "not yourself"
and "only the owner may archive an admin" guards do not apply to it. What does apply is
carried over exactly — **409 `{"error":"upcoming_bookings","count": n}`** while the person
still hosts a booking that has not happened (reassign or cancel first), **409
`{"error":"owner_cannot_be_archived"}`** for the owner, and their event types are
deactivated so the public pages stop taking bookings.

The same transaction deletes their **managed** API keys, their sessions and their MCP
access tokens. Archiving already blocks a key (`RequireAuth` requires `archived_at IS
NULL`), but leaving the rows would mean an un-archive through the upsert route silently
brings a live credential back on whatever host still holds it. Their own unmanaged keys are
left alone: those are the person's, not the platform's.

#### `PATCH …/{id}/webhooks` → 200 `{"updated": n}`

Body `{"url": "https://hooks.acme.example/in", "managed": true}`. Sets `managed = 1` on
every webhook in that workspace whose `url` matches exactly. Idempotent.

This is how a workspace provisioned before the `managed` column existed gets its
provisioning webhook marked. The migration could not do it: unlike the API key, whose name
(`platform-provisioned`) is written by exactly one statement in the codebase, a webhook row
carries nothing that distinguishes the platform's from one the workspace created — url,
events and fields are all values the caller chose. The platform knows which url it gave;
the database does not.

⛔ **`{"managed": false}` is 400.** Managed is one-way on purpose: the flag's value is that
a credential caller cannot reach the row, and an un-manage route is a way to reach it.
Deleting the row and re-creating it is the reversal.

### Managed rows

`api_keys.managed` and `webhooks.managed` mark a row the **platform** owns rather than the
workspace. Two rows created by `POST /v1/platform/workspaces` are managed from the moment
they are written: the `platform-provisioned` API key an integration spends, and the webhook
the platform receives bookings on. Both used to sit on the owner user, listed with a delete
button on the workspace's own settings pages, where one click broke the integration with
nothing on either side to say so.

| surface | managed row |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/api-keys`, `GET /v1/webhooks` | omitted |
| `DELETE /v1/api-keys/{id}`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /v1/webhooks/{id}` | **403** `{"error":"managed by your platform"}` |
| authentication (`RequireAuth`) | accepted, unchanged |
| webhook **delivery** | delivered, unchanged |

403 rather than 404: the row exists and the caller owns the user it hangs off, so "not
found" is a lie they can disprove, and the actionable answer is that the platform minted it.

⛔ **`managed` governs administration, never delivery.** The dispatcher's read
(`WHERE user_id = ? AND is_active = 1`) deliberately does not filter on it. A `managed = 0`
predicate added there for symmetry would stop the provisioning webhook delivering the
moment the row was marked — silently, with the row still present and still active.

Managed rows exist only in multi-tenant mode: nothing a credential caller can reach sets
the flag, and the only writers are the platform routes, which 404 on a single-tenant
instance.

## The SSO hand-off

The identity host cannot set a cookie for a tenant's domain, so after a Google or Microsoft login
the callback mints a short-lived token and redirects to the workspace's own host.

`GET https://<public_host>/v1/auth/sso?token=<compact HS256 JWS>[&next=/path]`

Claims: `iss`, `aud`, `sub` (email), `name`, `role` (`owner`\|`admin`\|`member`), `iat`, `exp`,
`jti`, `wid`. Verified with the shared secret; only HS256 is accepted, checked before the signature
is looked at.

- `exp - iat` ≤ 60 s, 30 s of clock skew allowed either way. The mint side uses 30 s.
- `jti` is claimed in `sso_nonces` **before** the session is created, so a replay inside the
  validity window loses on the primary key.
- ⛔ **The workspace comes from the HOST, and `wid` is checked against it.** Resolving from `wid`
  alone would let a token for workspace A, presented on B's host, create A's session on B's domain
  — a good signature, a resolvable `wid` and a matching audience, and the wrong outcome. A mismatch
  is 403.
- `aud` must equal `https://<that workspace's public_host>`, with no trailing slash.
- The user is created or resolved **in that workspace**, with `workspace_id` named, and the session
  row carries it too — every later request runs on a bound handle that could otherwise neither read
  nor delete it.
- `role` from the token applies only to a user it creates; an existing user's role is never
  rewritten by a sign-in.
- With `ADMIN_SPA=off` no route under `/admin` exists, so a hand-off carrying no `next` —
  **or one whose `next` lands under `/admin`** — is a 404 **before** the nonce is claimed
  and before the session is created. See [`ADMIN_SPA`](#admin_spa).

The login start carries the workspace in the state **cookie** (`<nonce>|<workspace_id>`) and sends
only the nonce to the provider. The nonce is compared, the workspace is read: a visitor can rewrite
the query parameter and achieve a failed login, and the value that selects the tenant never left
the server.

## Export, import, erasure

**Export** is one JSON document: `format_version`, `exported_at`, the workspace row, a
`dek_fingerprint`, and `tables` as an **ordered array** — parents before children, because import
replays it in the order it receives. Secrets and API-key hashes travel **verbatim**, because a
tenant whose keys and manage links stopped working on migration has not been migrated. The document
is therefore as sensitive as the database.

The table list is checked against the schema's own tenant-table list at request time, so a table
added by a later migration cannot be silently absent from every backup.

**Import** refuses (409) unless the workspace is empty, runs in one transaction, and **forces
`workspace_id` to the id in the URL** — the document's own value is discarded, or an export of any
workspace would be a way to write into any other.

⚠️ Row ids are global primary keys, so **import is a move, not a copy**: replaying a document into a
second workspace while the first still holds its rows collides on the primary key. The supported
sequence is export → delete → import, normally into another instance.

⛔ **The DEK fingerprint rule.** `crypto_keystore` holds one wrapped data key per **process**, not
per workspace, so the key itself does not travel — an export of one tenant containing the key that
decrypts every tenant would be the opposite of isolation. Instead the document carries a SHA-256 of
the *already-encrypted* wrapped key, and **import refuses 409 when it differs**. Without that
check the rows import perfectly and then every secret in them fails at first use, one integration
at a time, long after anyone is watching. Moving a workspace means moving
`CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with it.

**Erasure** (`DELETE …/attendees?email=`) removes the attendee rows for that address in that
workspace and returns counts. It cancels nothing: the bookings, the host's calendar and the other
attendees' records are not the erased person's data. Answers are keyed `(booking_id, question_id)`
and carry no attendee, so they are erased only for bookings where that person was the **only**
attendee — with anyone else on the booking, deleting them would erase a third party's data.

## Vendor webhooks

LiveKit and Stripe call in with their own signature and no tenant Host, so both routes are platform
routes that resolve the workspace from **our** row: the egress id or room on a recordings row, the
booking a room name encodes, or `bookings.stripe_session_id`. No resolver consults a `workspace_id`
in a vendor payload. An event no row owns is **2xx and ignored** — a 4xx would make the vendor retry
for days and no retry can make the row exist.

⚠️ In multi-tenant mode the resolve necessarily precedes the signature check, because the signing
credentials are per workspace: there is no instance-wide secret to verify against, and verifying
against an arbitrary tenant's is not verification. Nothing is written before the signature verifies
and nothing is disclosed either way. Single-tenant keeps the original verify-then-act order.

## What is NOT per tenant

| thing | why, and what it costs |
|---|---|
| **the data encryption key** | one wrapped DEK per process. An operator who can read the database can decrypt every workspace, and a workspace cannot move between instances without its key. The import fingerprint check makes the coupling loud rather than silent |
| **the OAuth app credentials** | Google/Microsoft client id and secret identify the *instance* to the provider, not the tenant |
| **rate-limit windows** | keyed `(workspace, credential-or-client-IP)` — see [Rate-limit buckets](#rate-limit-buckets) — but the counters live in one process |
| **retention sweeps** | expired sessions, tokens and deliveries are purged globally: they are retention rules, not tenant logic |
| **the security headers** | `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy` and conditional HSTS are set at the mux root for every response — see below. They describe the browser's relationship with this origin, which is a property of the deployment, not of the tenant whose host it happens to be |

## Response headers

Every response from this instance carries four headers, set by one middleware at the mux
root (M9) rather than by the handlers — which is where they used to live, so `/embed.js`,
`/booking.css`, every JSON error and every 404 carried none at all:

| header | value |
|---|---|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`, **only** on a request that arrived over TLS |

Two exceptions, both deliberate:

- **The LiveKit room** (`/room/…`) gets `camera=(self), microphone=(self), geolocation=()`.
  It is a video meeting, and a Permissions-Policy denial cannot be recovered from in
  JavaScript — `getUserMedia` simply rejects.
- **A handler that sets one of these keys keeps its own value.** The middleware sets before
  calling through, so the room's `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` survives, and so does
  anything a future surface tightens.

⛔ **HSTS is conditional on the request scheme** — a real TLS connection, or
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from the terminating proxy. Never on plain http: this binary is
also run by self-hosters on a LAN, and an accidental `includeSubDomains` pinned against a
hostname reachable only over http locks that operator out of their own installation for a
year with nothing to retract it with. The forwarded header is believed without consulting
`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`, unlike the rate limiter's client IP: forging it yields an HSTS
header that browsers honour only over https, i.e. only where it was true anyway, and
requiring the allowlist would leave HSTS off on every deployment that has not set one.

The public booking pages additionally set their own `Content-Security-Policy` and
`X-Frame-Options: DENY` — those are per surface and unchanged. The strict policy now
carries `'self'` in `script-src`, which it did not before M9: without it every same-origin
script was refused, which is why Cloudflare's injected
`/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/scripts/jsd/main.js` was a console error on every booking page.

## Operator checklist

1. PostgreSQL 16+ with two roles: an owner (`BYPASSRLS`) and an application role (`NOBYPASSRLS`,
   owning nothing, granted DML on the schema's tables).
2. Set `MULTI_TENANT`, both DSNs, `CALNODE_PLATFORM_TOKEN`, `CALNODE_SSO_SHARED_SECRET` (if social
   login is configured), `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (if behind a proxy), and `BASE_URL`.
3. Start. Boot order is: migrate on the platform handle → enable RLS → suspend the seeded `default`
   workspace → verify both roles. The first, second and fourth are fatal; the third is logged.
4. Point DNS for each tenant's `public_host` at the instance and terminate TLS for it.
5. Provision each workspace through `POST /v1/platform/workspaces`; store the `api_key` and
   `webhook_secret` from the response, which are shown once.
6. Verify with a request to each tenant's own host, and confirm an unknown host 404s.
7. Before moving a workspace between instances, move `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` too, or import will
   refuse the document.

## Cost

Measured with 200 workspaces provisioned through the API in one process: RSS 28.9 MB → 35.9 MB,
i.e. **~35 KB per tenant**, with the connection pool unchanged at one connection per role.
`ForWorkspace` returns a value over a shared pool, so tenants cost cache entries and rows, not
connections.
