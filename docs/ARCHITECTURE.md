# District Scheduler — Architecture

Status: living doc. The source of truth is the code; this explains how the pieces
fit and *why*. File references point at packages/symbols (`internal/...`). New to the
codebase? Start here, then see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for build/test.

---

## 1. What District Scheduler is

A self-hostable scheduling/booking app (Calendly-style) shipped as a **single Go
binary**. The Go server embeds the built SvelteKit admin SPA at compile time and
also serves the public, server-rendered booking pages. Persistence is **SQLite or
PostgreSQL**, selected by the `DATABASE_URL` scheme (§4).

One binary, two deployment shapes:

- **Single tenant**, the default and upstream Calnode's own shape. One process, one
  file (`data/calnode.db`), no external services required to run (SMTP and Google
  are optional integrations configured at runtime). Nothing on the request path
  carries a tenant predicate, because there is no tenant to resolve.
- **Multi tenant**, when `MULTI_TENANT` is set. One process serves many isolated
  workspaces on PostgreSQL, the isolation boundary is row-level security in the
  database rather than a predicate a query author has to remember, and an external
  platform provisions workspaces over an API. See §25 and
  [MULTI_TENANT.md](MULTI_TENANT.md).

This repository is Distronode Corporation's fork of
[Calnode](https://github.com/Calnode/calnode). The PostgreSQL support, the
multi-tenant mode and the PostgreSQL-only image are the fork's; everything else is
upstream's. With `MULTI_TENANT` unset the two behave identically, and that is a gate
rather than an aspiration: every test that existed before the mode passes without
modification.

---

## 2. Topology — two frontends, one binary

Deliberate split (see CLAUDE.md):

| Surface | Tech | Served at | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin app** | SvelteKit 2 SPA (Svelte 5, Vite 8, Tailwind 4, shadcn-svelte/bits-ui) | `/admin/*` | Rich, authenticated, many interactive pages → a framework SPA earns its weight. Embedded via `//go:embed all:build` (`frontend/embed.go`). |
| **Public pages** | Server-rendered Go `html/template` + vanilla JS | `/book/{slug}`, `/manage/{token}` | A booker clicking an email link should get instant first paint and a tiny payload — hand-written HTML beats shipping a framework runtime. |
| **Favicon** | single embedded `favicon.svg` | `/favicon.svg`, `/favicon.ico`, `/admin/favicon.svg` | One source (`frontend.FaviconHandler`) shared by all pages. |

Consequence/debt: two styling systems (Tailwind/shadcn in the SPA; hand-written
CSS in the Go templates). The two Go templates (`book.html`, `manage.html`) are
kept visually in sync by hand — `manage.html` mirrors `book.html`'s styles +
calendar/slot JS. **If you change one calendar, change both.**

Frontend is embedded at **compile time**. To see frontend changes in the running
app you must `pnpm build` in `frontend/` **and** rebuild/restart the Go binary
(`make build` does both). Restarting Go alone won't pick up new assets.

---

## 3. Process, config, startup

- Entry: `cmd/calnode/main.go`. Sibling CLI tools: `recover_key.go`, `rotate_key.go`,
  `reset_admin.go` (key escrow recovery, KEK rotation, admin reset).
- Config: `internal/config` — env-driven. Key vars:
  - `PORT` (3000), `DATABASE_URL` (`sqlite://./data/calnode.db`)
  - `BASE_URL` — identity host (OAuth callbacks, admin UI, invites)
  - `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` — booker-facing host (booking links, emails); defaults to BASE_URL. The split lets a tenant put the team on a custom domain (`book.acme.com`) while OAuth/admin stay on the identity host (see §16).
  - `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (platform secret / KEK input), `CALNODE_RECOVERY_SECRET` (escrow)
  - `SMTP_*` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` (also settable at runtime in DB settings, which take priority)
  - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` and `MICROSOFT_TENANT` (default `common`; use the
    multi-tenant `common` so any work/personal Microsoft account can connect/sign in)
  - `COOKIE_SECURE` (defaults true when BASE_URL is https)
  - `STT_BASE_URL` — speech-to-text endpoint **host** for the notetaker; defaults to
    `stt.DefaultBaseURL` (`https://api.deepgram.com`). Set it to a regional endpoint to
    keep recording audio inside one jurisdiction. Only the host is configurable: the path,
    model and transcription options stay Calnode's (`internal/stt`'s `listenPath`), so an
    operator picks a region and not a different request. Surfaced **read-only** as
    `stt_base_url` in `GET /v1/settings/notetaker` — an admin should be able to read where
    audio is sent without shelling into the container, and should not be able to repoint it
    from a browser session, which is why it is env-only rather than a DB setting like the
    API key beside it.
- Startup (`internal/server/server.go: New`): open DB → run goose migrations →
  open keyvault (unwrap DEK) → configure mailer (DB settings override env) → start
  webhook/reminder **worker** → load Google creds (DB > env) → build one
  `calendar.Service` and **register every configured provider** (Google, Microsoft) →
  wire up the matching **OAuth login** providers (Google and/or Microsoft) → if any
  calendar is configured, **start the calendar reconciler** → register routes →
  return handler + a `drain` func.
- Ops endpoints: `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz` (readiness gate), `GET /version`
  (build stamp from `internal/buildinfo`).
- **`GET /metrics`** — Prometheus text exposition, hand-written in `internal/metrics`
  (no client library, for the reason `internal/livekit` signs its own tokens: a
  one-page stable text protocol is not worth a dependency tree in a self-hosted
  binary). Series: `calnode_build_info{version,commit}`,
  `calnode_http_requests_total{class,status}`,
  `calnode_http_request_duration_seconds` (histogram, fixed buckets),
  `calnode_jobs_pending`, `calnode_jobs_failed`,
  `calnode_bookings_total{event}` for created/cancelled/rescheduled,
  `process_start_time_seconds`, `go_goroutines`, `go_memstats_alloc_bytes`.
  ⛔ **Gated on `Authorization: Bearer $METRICS_TOKEN`, and it answers 404** — identical
  to the mux's own not-found — when the token is unset or wrong. Not 401: a 401 confirms
  the endpoint exists, and these numbers are a business feed (bookings per hour, request
  volume by surface) on an instance meant to be publicly reachable. Not rate-limited
  either; a scrape runs every few seconds by design and a limiter would punch gaps that
  read as downtime.
  `class` is derived from the path **prefix only** (`public|admin|api|mcp|ops`), so the
  label set is closed and can never be attacker-chosen — the usual way a metrics endpoint
  becomes an out-of-memory vector. Read it as "which surface of the URL space", not "how
  the request authenticated": `POST /v1/bookings` is public and unauthenticated and still
  counts as `api`. Requests are counted in the existing `Logging` middleware, the only
  place that already knows the final status and elapsed time; job depth is read from the
  `jobs` table per scrape, because any instance can claim any job. A host **reassignment**
  fires the `booking.rescheduled` webhook but is deliberately **not** counted as a
  reschedule — it does not move the meeting.
- Graceful shutdown drains the worker and in-flight requests before `db.Close()`.

---

## 4. Persistence (SQLite or PostgreSQL) — and the single-connection rule

- `internal/db`: `OpenDB(DATABASE_URL)` picks the engine from the URL scheme. A
  `postgres://` URL selects PostgreSQL; everything else (`sqlite://./rel`,
  `sqlite:///abs`, `:memory:`, a bare path) selects SQLite, so every configuration
  that worked before still works unchanged.
- SQLite: **`SetMaxOpenConns(1)`** + `SetMaxIdleConns(1)`, **WAL** journal mode,
  `busy_timeout=5000`. One writer connection by design.
- PostgreSQL: a normal pool (10 open / 5 idle). The single connection above is a
  SQLite constraint, not a Calnode design choice, and carrying it over would
  serialise the whole instance on an engine with its own concurrency control.
- The handle rebinds placeholders: Calnode's SQL is written once with `?` and
  rewritten to `$1…$n` on PostgreSQL. ⚠️ `db.DB` embeds `*sql.DB` and the field is
  exported, so `h.DB.Query(...)` compiles and **skips rebinding** — it passes on
  SQLite and fails on PostgreSQL with a syntax error far from the edit. Call the
  wrapper's own methods. The handful of statements no single spelling covers use
  `Dialect.SQL(sqlite, postgres)`.
- Timestamps are computed in Go (`internal/dbtime`) rather than by the engine;
  `datetime('now')` and `strftime` do not exist in PostgreSQL. `dbtime` keeps the
  two layouts the schema already stores, byte-identical to what SQLite wrote.
- Migrations: **goose** SQL files in `internal/db/migrations/{sqlite,postgres}/` —
  one schema, two spellings, same version numbers. Run automatically on startup.
  `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` is reversible-by-convention only (SQLite can't easily
  drop columns).

### ⛔ A TEXT timestamp column must be `COLLATE "C"` (PostgreSQL only)

Timestamps are stored as TEXT, and ~20 predicates in the tree compare them
lexicographically (`run_at <= ?`, `expires_at > ?`, `locked_until < ?`, the
`start_at`/`end_at` overlap, several `ORDER BY created_at`). SQLite's BINARY
collation *is* memcmp, so those comparisons are byte order there. PostgreSQL's
default is the database's own collation, which is not. Migration 00059 therefore
pins `COLLATE "C"` on **54 columns across 27 tables**: every `*_at`, plus
`availability_rules.start_time`/`end_time` and `availability_overrides.date`/
`start_time`/`end_time`, which hold `HH:MM` and `YYYY-MM-DD` and are ordered as
times too. The SQLite half of that migration is an intentional no-op file.

Fixed in the schema rather than in the predicates on purpose: a `COLLATE "C"`
clause on each of ~20 comparisons is ~20 chances to forget one, and forgetting is
silent. ⚠️ The load-bearing site is `internal/handler/notetaker.go`, which writes
`datetime('now')`'s space-separated shape *because* it sorts before any
`T`-separated stamp, which is what makes a notetaker job due immediately. That is a
production dependency on byte ordering, not a theoretical one.

`internal/db/collation_test.go` is the guard, and it matters that it holds three
things rather than one. (a) An audit over `information_schema.columns` matching by
column NAME, so a timestamp column added by a later migration is caught without
anyone remembering this rule. (b) An ordering control that **skips naming the
server's collation** when the server's default already orders byte-wise, rather
than passing vacuously: on `en_US.utf8` the two shapes the schema actually stores
do not flip, and neither do they under any of the other 878 collations on that
server, so a control built only on those would be green with or without the
migration. It therefore also carries RFC 3339's permitted lower-case `t`/`z`
spelling, where the two orders genuinely differ. (c) An ordering test on
`jobs.run_at` through the worker's real claim predicate. ⛔ `SHOW lc_collate` is a
dead end for checking a server: it stopped being a GUC in PostgreSQL 16 and errors
with "unrecognized configuration parameter". Read `datcollate` from `pg_database`.

### ⚠️ The single-connection gotcha (bit us once) — SQLite only

With one connection, **never run a query while a `rows` cursor from the same pool
is still open** (i.e. inside a `for rows.Next()` loop). The open cursor holds the
only connection; the inner query waits for a connection that never frees →
deadlock until context deadline, surfacing as a confusing `context deadline
exceeded` (not "database is locked"). **Pattern:** read the cursor fully into a
slice, close it, then loop. See `Handler.assignedHosts`, the calendar reconciler,
`Reschedule`. (Memory: `sqlite-single-connection`.)

This is a consequence of the single connection, so it does not apply on
PostgreSQL — but the materialise-first pattern must stay, because it is the only
thing keeping those three paths working on SQLite.

### The double-booking guarantee, per engine

The app-level overlap check reads "is this host free?" and then writes on the
answer. What keeps that free of TOCTOU races differs:

- **SQLite** — booking transactions serialize on the single connection, so the
  check reliably guards **all** hosts, not just the one the partial unique index
  covers.
- **PostgreSQL** — the pool has many connections, so two overlapping bookings could
  both clear the check. `booking.lockHosts` takes **`pg_advisory_xact_lock`** on
  each host id before the first overlap read, in `Create`, `Reschedule` and
  `ReassignHost`. The key is SHA-256 of `"calnode:booking:host:" + hostID`, first
  eight bytes as an int64; ids are locked in sorted order so two transactions
  needing the same pair cannot deadlock. The lock ends with the transaction, so
  there is nothing to release. On SQLite it is a no-op.

Both engines also carry the partial unique index
`idx_bookings_no_double (host_id, start_at) WHERE status != 'cancelled'`. It catches
an **identical** start time and nothing else — a partial overlap is two distinct
keys — which is why the app-level check and the lock exist and why all three stay.
Measured on PostgreSQL, 40 races between overlapping-but-not-identical slots: with
the lock, 0 double bookings; without it, 39, of which the index caught one.

### Data model (key tables)

- **Identity/authz:** `users` (+ `is_admin`, `is_owner`, `archived_at`,
  `archived_by`, plus prefs `time_format`/`week_start`/`date_format`, seven
  `notify_*` toggles, and auth columns `email_login`/`password_hash`/`provider`/
  `provider_id`), `sessions` (cookie auth), `api_keys` (SHA-256 hashed),
  `invite_tokens` (hashed, single-use). **There is no `auth_providers` table** —
  OAuth identity is columns on `users` (migration 00012).
- **Teams:** `teams`, `team_members` (with `routing_priority`).
- **Event types:** `event_types` (+ `routing_mode` — CHECK has **four** values:
  fixed | round_robin | collective | priority; `rr_strategy`; `max_active_bookings`
  (per-invitee cap, enforced); `seat_limit` (group/class — column exists but is
  **not enforced**); `team_id` — vestigial for routing), `event_type_hosts`
  (the host-roles table), `event_type_questions` (intake form),
  `event_type_reminders` (per-ET `hours_before`, UNIQUE).
- **Availability:** `availability_rules` (weekly), `availability_overrides` (dated).
- **Bookings:** `bookings` (primary `host_id`, `external_event_id`, status),
  `booking_hosts` (every attending host + `is_primary` + per-host
  `external_event_id`), `booking_attendees` (organizer + invitees),
  `booking_answers`, `booking_manage_tokens` (PK is the hashed token; TTL is
  app-level, set by `IssueManageToken`, not a schema constraint).
  Note: `bookings.host_id` and `booking_hosts.user_id` carry **no ON DELETE
  clause** (NO ACTION), and `users.archived_by` is a bare TEXT column (no FK) —
  which is *why* member offboarding is archive, not delete.
- **Integrations/secrets:** `calendar_connections` (per-user OAuth tokens, encrypted;
  `provider` = `google`|`microsoft`, `is_destination`/`check_conflicts` roles, and
  `account_kind` work|personal from migration 00032),
  `server_settings` (a **singleton** row id=1 holding SMTP + Google creds —
  encrypted `smtp_pass_enc`, `google_client_secret_enc`), `crypto_keystore` (wrapped
  DEK + recovery escrow), `webhooks` + `webhook_deliveries`, `jobs` (worker queue).

All timestamps are **UTC**. Times are rendered in the host's / booker's local tz
at the edges only.

---

## 5. Security & crypto (envelope encryption)

`internal/keyvault` + `internal/secret`:

- A random **DEK** (AES-256) encrypts secret columns via **AES-256-GCM** (random
  12-byte nonce). The encrypted columns have grown with each integration — as of
  migration `00045`, that's **13 column instances across 4 tables**:
  `calendar_connections.access_token_enc` + `refresh_token_enc`,
  `zoom_connections.access_token_enc` + `refresh_token_enc` (its own table — Zoom is
  a meeting-link provider, not a calendar), `webhooks.secret_enc` (webhook signing
  secret), and eight `server_settings` columns: `smtp_pass_enc`,
  `google_client_secret_enc`, `zoom_client_secret_enc`, `llm_api_key_enc`,
  `stripe_secret_key_enc`, `stripe_webhook_secret_enc`, `livekit_api_secret_enc`,
  `stt_api_key_enc` (Deepgram). Grep `_enc` across `internal/db/migrations/*.sql` for
  the current authoritative list — new integrations keep adding columns here.
- The DEK is stored **wrapped** in `crypto_keystore`, encrypted by a **KEK** =
  `Argon2id(CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY)` — params **64 MiB / 3 iterations / 2 lanes**,
  16-byte salt; the wrap is AES-256-GCM. A second wrapped copy is escrowed under
  `CALNODE_RECOVERY_SECRET` — but **only if that env was set at first boot**.
- On startup the vault unwraps the DEK ("DEK unwrapped from keystore (primary)").
- CLI tools: `rotate_key` re-wraps the **same DEK** under a new platform secret
  (it does **not** rotate the DEK or re-encrypt columns); `recover_key` unwraps via
  the recovery escrow; `reset_admin` is a bcrypt password reset (not part of the
  crypto subsystem).
- **Dev caveat:** with no `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and a non-https BASE_URL, the
  vault generates an **ephemeral per-process DEK** (so any persisted `*_enc` data is
  unreadable across restarts). Production (https BASE_URL) hard-fails without the key.

So the DB at rest contains only ciphertext + a wrapped key; losing the DB without
the platform/recovery secret doesn't expose secrets.

---

## 6. Auth, sessions, roles

- **API keys** (`cno_…`, **SHA-256**-hashed in `api_keys`) and **browser sessions**
  (cookie `calnode_session`, HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax/Secure-when-https, **30-day**,
  stored in `sessions`) both satisfy `RequireAuth` (`internal/handler/auth.go`).
  Note: a *present-but-invalid* API key is rejected outright — it does NOT fall
  through to the session path (confused-deputy guard).
- **Login paths:** **Google OAuth** (`/v1/auth/login` → `/v1/auth/callback`),
  **Microsoft OAuth** (`/v1/auth/microsoft/login` → `/v1/auth/microsoft/callback`),
  and **email+password** (`email_login` + bcrypt). Both OAuth flows are identity-only
  (Google `openid email profile`; Microsoft `openid email profile User.Read` — calendar
  access is a *separate* connection with its own scopes), share helpers in
  `auth_oauth.go` (`newOAuthState`/`verifyOAuthState`/`finishOAuthLogin`), map a user
  **by email**, and **cannot create users** (unknown email → `no_account`). Microsoft
  needs its own redirect URI registered in Azure (`/v1/auth/microsoft/callback`),
  distinct from the calendar one. (Magic-link login is also shipped —
  `POST /v1/auth/magic-link/request` + `GET …/verify`, `magic_link.go`, migration
  00040 — alongside password auth.) The actual user-creation path for non-first
  users is **invites** (`invite_tokens`), not OAuth self-registration.
- **CSRF:** cookie sessions are `SameSite=Lax` (blocks the classic cross-site write),
  plus a `SameOriginCheck` middleware (`internal/server`) that rejects a state-changing
  request whose Origin/Referer host ≠ the request Host — but only when the
  `calnode_session` cookie is present, so public booking, API-key, and manage-token
  requests are untouched. API-key auth isn't CSRF-able (custom header).
- **Roles:** Member / Admin / Owner. `is_owner` is additive over `is_admin`.
  Owner-gated actions: grant/revoke admin, transfer ownership. Admins can cancel
  any booking, see all bookings, manage teams/members. Safe-removal + archive
  guards prevent orphaning.
- **Sign out everywhere** (`POST /v1/auth/sessions/revoke-all`, `session.go`). With no
  body it drops all of the caller's sessions **except the one that made the request** —
  "sign out my other devices", as distinct from `POST /v1/auth/logout`, which ends the
  current one. (An API-key caller has no current session, so for them every session
  goes.) With `{"user_id": "..."}` it is an offboarding tool, gated on the same tiers as
  `roles.go`: an admin may revoke a member, only the owner may revoke another admin, and
  the owner's sessions are reachable only by the owner. The actor's tier is checked
  *before* the target is loaded, so the 404 cannot be used to enumerate user ids.
  ⛔ It also deletes the target's rows in **`oauth_access_tokens`**, cutting off any MCP
  connector (§19) — those authenticate with a bearer token, not the session cookie, so
  revoking sessions alone would leave an agent holding the authority just withdrawn.
  Both deletes run in one transaction, so "revoked" is never half-true.
  This endpoint signs someone out; it does not offboard them. Offboarding is archive
  (the "Offboarding = archive" bullet below), which ends MCP access on its own: the OAuth bearer check and the
  refresh grant both refuse an archived member. API keys
  (`cno_`) are deliberately left alone here, which is safe only because an archived
  member's keys are already refused (the key path in `auth.go`), so an offboarded
  member's keys stop working through archive, not through this endpoint.
- **Signed session hand-off** (`GET /v1/auth/sso?token=<jwt>`, `sso.go`) lets an
  external identity system that has already authenticated someone drop them into a
  Calnode session without a second login. **Off unless `CALNODE_SSO_SHARED_SECRET` is
  set** — an unconfigured instance answers **404**, deliberately indistinguishable from
  a build without the feature. The token is a compact **HS256** JWT verified in-tree
  (`crypto/hmac`, like `internal/livekit`'s signing) with a constant-time compare; only
  HS256 is accepted, checked *before* the signature so the `alg: none` downgrade never
  reaches it. Claims: `iss` (any non-empty string, logged only), `aud` = `BASE_URL`
  (what stops a staging token being spent on production when a secret is shared by
  mistake), `sub` = email, `name`, `role` ∈ owner|admin|member, `iat`, `exp` at most
  **60 s** after `iat` with **30 s** of clock skew allowed either way, and a unique
  `jti`. `wid` is parsed and ignored — a multi-workspace mode will use it. The `jti` is
  claimed in **`sso_nonces`** *before* the session is created, so a replay inside the
  validity window collides on the primary key rather than racing a read-then-write; the
  worker purges expired rows in its GC pass (§13). Success is a 302 to `/admin/`, or to
  `?next=` when that is a same-origin absolute path (anything with a scheme, a `//`
  prefix, a backslash or a control character is a 400, refused rather than sanitised).
  Every other failure is a 401 whose JSON body names the claim that failed. Rate-limited
  like the OAuth callbacks.
  ⛔ **This is the one path that creates a user without an invite.** Everywhere else an
  unknown email is refused (`no_account`); here the shared secret is the difference — the
  caller is the operator's own identity system. On creation the claim's `role` is applied;
  on an existing user the role is **not** rewritten, except that a claim asking for
  `owner` bootstraps ownership when the instance has none (the one-owner invariant §6
  maintains means there is nothing to displace). An archived user is still refused.
- **Offboarding = archive** (`users.archived_at`), never hard-delete — preserves
  bookings, event-type ownership, team links. Archived ⇒ no login, hidden from
  lists, skipped in routing/slots, event types deactivated. Reversible (restore).
  "No login" holds on every auth path: sessions, API keys, and MCP OAuth bearers
  all filter on `archived_at`, and refresh grants are refused for archived users
  too — so archiving ends a member's agent access and leaves no usable
  credential material behind.
  Archiving is blocked while the member has upcoming (primary-host) bookings; a
  resolve-meetings flow makes the admin reassign/cancel each first.

---

## 7. Routing — the host-roles model

An administrator who owns an event can transfer it to an active required host with `POST /v1/event-types/{slug}/transfer`. The request supplies `expected_owner_id` and `new_owner_id`. Upcoming bookings prevent transfer. The event ID, slug, and historical booking hosts are preserved. Event-specific availability rules move to the new owner; global availability and calendar connections do not.

An event type owns a **host list** (`event_type_hosts`): each row = (user, role,
priority), role ∈ **required | rotation | optional**. The editor authors these
roles through **two plain questions** rather than a mode picker — *who can host?*
(just me / specific people) and, for people, *how are they staffed?* (rotate /
everyone attends). `routing_mode` is **derived** from the two answers, never set
directly (`frontend/src/routes/event-types/[slug]/+page.svelte`):

| Q1 | Q2 | `routing_mode` | Roles written |
|---|---|---|---|
| Just me | — | `fixed` | owner → `required` |
| Specific people | Rotate | `round_robin` | each → `rotation` (+ `rr_strategy`) |
| Specific people | Everyone attends | `collective` | each → `required`; per-person **Optional** toggle → `optional` (join-if-free) |

Everyone is `required` by default in the "Everyone attends" branch, so the common
case has no extra knobs; flipping a person to **Optional** is the only refinement.
The old "fixed host inside a rotation" combo (a `required` host alongside a
rotation pool) is no longer authorable from the UI — the engine still supports it,
but no editor path writes it.

**The one rule** — a slot is offered when: all `required` hosts free **AND** (if a
rotation pool exists) ≥1 rotation host free. At booking time the assignment is: all
required + one rotation pick (by strategy) + every free optional; always ≥1 attendee.

`rr_strategy`: `even` (least-loaded — fewest upcoming confirmed via this event
type; `leastLoadedHost`), `priority` (lowest priority number free first), `soonest`
(falls back to even at assignment — the slot is already fixed). Free rotation
candidates stay in priority order; `pickRotationHost` switches on strategy
(`internal/booking/service.go`).

Note: the `routing_mode` column actually carries **four** values — the schema also
defines a distinct `priority` mode alongside `fixed`/`round_robin`/`collective`
(ranked single-host) — though the two-question editor only ever writes the three in
the table; ranked selection within a rotation is expressed via `rr_strategy =
priority`.

Teams are just a one-click way to populate the host list; `event_types.team_id` is
vestigial for routing. The resolver (`resolveEventTypeHosts`) excludes archived
members.

---

## 8. Slot generation

Booking and rescheduling pages and the embed widget group the displayed starts into morning (before 12:00), afternoon (12:00–16:59), and evening (17:00 onward), in the selected timezone. Only groups with slots are shown. The time grid has no nested scrolling region. Taken slots remain disabled when the event opts to display them.

- Engine: `internal/slots/generate.go`. Input: `[]HostAvailability` (rules,
  overrides, busy intervals, **Role**), `EventConfig` (duration, interval, buffers,
  min-notice, max-future, `RoutingMode`), date range, booker tz, injectable `Now`.
- Computes per-host free windows per UTC day, intersects/subtracts busy, aligns to
  the slot interval, then `pickHosts` decides per-slot which hosts to surface:
  - `collective`: all hosts must be free → return all.
  - `round_robin`: every **required** (fixed) host free, **and** one free rotation
    host (priority order) → return required + the pick. No rotation pick available
    ⇒ not offered (kept consistent with booking-time assignment, which always needs
    a rotation pick).
  - `fixed`/default: the single host if free.
- **Slot interval is NOT the duration.** `slot_interval_minutes` is how often a booking may
  *start*; `duration_minutes` is how long it *runs*. They are deliberately independent, which
  is what lets a 45-minute meeting be offered on the hour. New event types default the
  interval to the duration (a fixed default of 30 was wrong in both directions: a 15-minute
  event offered slots every 30 minutes, a 90-minute one offered starts it could not honour),
  and the editor exposes it. **Existing event types keep whatever is stored** - the default
  only applies at create. Reported as issue #13, where the invisible setting looked like
  duration being ignored. `slots.Generate` rejects a non-positive interval, so both create
  and update validate it; a `0` would otherwise leave an event type with no bookable times
  and nothing explaining why.
- Handler: `internal/handler/slots_handler.go: GetSlots`. Resolves the host pool by
  mode (role-tagged), then loads each host's availability **concurrently**
  (goroutines) — the slow part is one Google free/busy round-trip per host, so
  parallelizing turns N sequential calls into ~one call's latency. DB queries
  serialize on SQLite's single connection (fast); only the network overlaps. Response
  includes a `hosts` metadata map (id→name/avatar) for rendering faces.
- **Busy** for a host = every non-cancelled booking they attend, via
  `booking_hosts` (NOT just `bookings.host_id`) — so a non-primary Group/fixed seat
  also blocks their availability and prevents cross-event double-booking.
- **Own-event exclusion (§6.2):** Calnode's own events also surface in Google
  free/busy, so the handler subtracts them (`slots.SubtractIntervals`) — the DB is
  the source of truth for Calnode bookings. The cut set is this host's bookings with
  a non-empty `booking_hosts.external_event_id` (any status). This de-duplicates
  confirmed bookings and, crucially, frees a slot whose booking was *cancelled* but
  whose Google event hasn't been deleted yet — without waiting for the reconciler.
- **Timezone boundary:** slots are generated per host-local day but bookings are
  stored UTC; a morning slot for a +UTC host maps to the previous UTC day. The busy
  fetch window is widened ±1–2 days so it isn't missed (regression-tested in
  `slots_busy_test.go`).

### Client calendar perf (book.html / manage.html)

- **Optimistic render:** the calendar paints immediately treating every in-window
  day as available/clickable; when the month's availability returns it re-renders
  to grey out only days with zero slots. No blocking on the network for first paint.
- **Month-slot cache:** the month-availability request already returns *every* slot
  for the month — it's cached grouped by day (`slotsByDay`), so clicking a day reads
  from memory (instant, zero extra requests). Falls back to a single-day fetch if
  clicked before the month load lands. Timezone change rebuilds the cache.

### Showing booked times ("taken" slots)

`event_types.show_taken_slots` (migration 00057, **default off**) opts one event type
into rendering already-booked starts struck through instead of hiding them. Requested
in discussion #14, issue #19.

- **Why it is opt-in.** `/slots` is public and unauthenticated, so this makes a host's
  booked hours legible to anyone with the link. Fair for a public-hours use case (an
  intro call, a clinic), a privacy regression for an instance fronting a team's internal
  calendars. Never inherited by upgrading; a test asserts the field is absent until
  chosen.
- **"Taken" is defined by difference, not by reason.** `slots.GenerateWithTaken` walks
  the range twice - once normally, once with every host's `Busy` ignored - and reports
  what the second pass offered and the first did not. This is correct for every routing
  mode with no special-casing, and it makes three mislabellings *structurally*
  impossible: a start outside working hours, one withheld by minimum notice, and one
  lost to a host pool that cannot satisfy the routing mode are absent from both passes
  and cancel out. Greying a slot asserts "somebody booked this", so saying it about a
  time the host does not work would mislead the booker and expose the working day.
  Buffers *do* count as taken; the start really is unbookable.
- **Taken slots carry no host ids.** The page needs the time; naming who is busy
  discloses more about an individual than greying requires.
- **Agents never see them.** `computeSlots` takes an explicit `includeTaken`, and MCP
  `get_available_slots` and the booking assistant both pass false. A taken slot in an
  agent's list is one it will eventually offer, with nothing in the payload to tell it
  apart. Asserted at the MCP surface with the event type opted in.
- **`taken` is absent, not empty, when off** - a client must distinguish "does not show
  taken times" from "opted in, nothing booked today".
- **Client side:** `mergeDaySlots` and `bookableDayKeys` in the shared
  `assets/booking-logic.js`, inlined into book.html and manage.html. **The embed widget
  does not load that module** - `EmbedJS` serves `embed.js` as standalone bytes, so
  `BookingLogic` is undefined inside it and it carries its own copies of the helpers it
  needs (a test asserts it never calls into `BookingLogic`). Free and
  taken stay separate on the wire and are combined only for display. `bookableDayKeys`
  exists for a specific trap: once taken slots are grouped by day too, a fully booked
  day still produces a key, and using those keys for the calendar would advertise it as
  having something available. Fully booked days *are* still openable, deliberately - a
  list of struck-through times explains itself better than a dead date.

### Explaining an empty day, and the minimum-notice gap

Two silences on the booker-facing surfaces, issue #20. A day with nothing on it used to
render a bare "No available times.", which does not say whether another day would help;
and `min_notice_minutes` removes the nearest starts with nothing left behind to explain
them - the most common "why can't I see those times".

- **The empty-day message names the day, and the host when there is one.**
  `no_available_times` takes the date; `no_available_times_host` adds the host. The host
  is named only when the event type (or, on manage, the booking) has exactly ONE -
  `HostsLabel` can be "Alex, Sam & 2 others", which cannot be the subject of that
  sentence in any shipped locale. `SoleHostName` on both page data structs is empty
  otherwise, and the surfaces fall back to the date-only form.
- **The notice gap is computed server-side, in the engine that already knows it.**
  `slots.GenerateDetailed(req, slots.Extras{NoticeGap: true})` reports the starts the
  notice rule removed. Collected during the main walk (the cutoff is evaluated there
  anyway), not by a second pass like `taken`.
- **Two exclusions keep the attribution honest.** A start already in the past is never
  reported - it would have gone with no policy at all, and blaming the policy would put
  the message on every event type by dinnertime. And busy intervals are applied on the
  way in, so a start a booking took away is never reported either: `NoticeGap` and
  `Taken` are therefore disjoint, and no start is ever explained two ways. Routing rules
  are applied to the withheld starts too, so a start no host pool could satisfy is not
  blamed on the policy.
- **The wire carries days, not times.** `GET /slots` returns
  `min_notice: {minutes, dates}`, where `dates` are booker-local `YYYY-MM-DD` keys
  matching what the surfaces group slots by. Sending the individual withheld times would
  describe the host's working hours at a finer grain than the feature needs. Absent when
  the event type sets no minimum notice, present-with-empty-`dates` when it set one that
  cost this range nothing - the same distinction `taken` draws.
- **The label is server-rendered.** `MinNoticeLabel` on the book/manage page data and
  `min_notice_label` on `GET /public` (for the widget), both via `durationLabel`, because
  the `/slots` call the surfaces make carries no `?lang=` - a label derived from its
  response would silently ignore a language override. `minutes` still travels for clients
  with no label of their own.
- **Where it renders.** On the day itself when that day lost starts, whether or not times
  remain (a day showing 2pm onwards but nothing this morning is exactly the case in the
  issue), and *also* in the "pick a day" state, because a day the policy emptied
  completely is greyed out in the calendar and cannot be clicked for an explanation.

## 9. Booking lifecycle

New public and assistant bookings recheck selected external calendars before committing. This uses the same buffer orientation and own-event subtraction as the slots page and checks each required host; round-robin routing filters busy candidates and busy optional guests are omitted. A failed provider check rejects the request with HTTP 503 and a retry message; a busy slot returns HTTP 409. Assistant and MCP bookings keep the same distinction. The external check and database write cannot share a transaction. Rescheduling still uses the existing validation path.

Google Meet and Teams event types can opt into `allow_phone_call`. Their booking page and widget then accept an optional `phone` value. A valid number selects a telephone appointment; leaving it empty preserves video. The booking stores its own location type so management pages, calendar retries, and paid confirmation do not generate a video link for a telephone appointment. Event duplication preserves the setting.

`internal/booking/service.go` (transactions) + `internal/handler/booking_handler.go`
(HTTP + async side effects).

- **Create:** in one transaction — overlap-check each candidate (required all free;
  rotation pick one free; optional join if free) via the `booking_hosts`-join
  predicate; enforce the per-invitee active-booking cap (by email, inside the txn);
  insert `bookings` (host_id = primary) + a `booking_hosts` row per attendee
  (`is_primary` flag) + attendee + answers. Double-book is guarded by both the
  app-level check (serialized) and a partial unique index on (host_id, start_at).
  HTTP 201 returns immediately; **side effects run in a background goroutine**:
  per-host Google Calendar event creation (store `external_event_id` per host),
  per-host confirmation emails (by prefs), attendee confirmation, webhook, reminders.
  **Idempotency (opt-in):** an `Idempotency-Key` header reserves the request
  (`idempotency_keys`, migration 00024); a retry with the same key + body replays
  the original 201 verbatim instead of creating a duplicate (agent/retry safety),
  a key reused with a *different* body → 422, and the key is released on any failure
  so a genuine retry can proceed. Worker purges keys after 24h (§13). The public
  booking page sends no key, so this path is inert for normal bookings.
- **List / filter / paginate:** `booking.ListFilter` + `booking.List`/`Counts`
  (`internal/booking/list.go`) is the one place bookings are selected. It applies
  visibility (`ViewerID` pins a member to bookings they host, primary *or* assigned;
  empty means the whole workspace and callers gate that on admin), then narrows by
  event type, host, team, status, date range and upcoming/past, then orders and pages
  - **all in SQL**. `GET /v1/bookings` and MCP `list_bookings` both go through it, and
  the admin page passes its filters straight down.
  - **Why it isn't done in the client:** the list used to return *every* booking the
    caller could see, then run enrichment queries whose `IN` clause held every id
    returned, on the single-connection pool (§17). Pages are capped
    (`bookingsPageMax`).
  - **Paging needs the index to mean anything.** Both pre-existing indexes on
    `bookings` lead on `host_id` and are partial, so a listing planned as
    `SCAN ... USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY`: the whole matching set sorted to return
    25 rows. Migration 00056 adds `(start_at, id)` and
    `(event_type_id, start_at, id)`, which turn that into an index walk that stops at
    the `LIMIT`. `Counts` is an aggregate over the match set and still scans; that is
    inherent, and it replaced a scan that also materialised every row.
  - `Counts` is a separate query and deliberately ignores `When`/`Limit`/`Offset`, so
    the Upcoming/Past tab labels describe the whole match set rather than the page.
    Deriving them from `len(items)` is the obvious mistake once paging exists.
  - **An explicit `status` replaces the default cancelled-exclusion rather than
    filtering after it.** Both list paths previously hardcoded `status != 'cancelled'`
    and filtered on top, so `status=cancelled` - a value MCP's own schema advertises -
    could never match anything.
  - **Teams resolve through membership**, not `event_types.team_id`: that column exists
    but nothing writes it, because a team is a shortcut for populating
    `event_type_hosts`. A member of two teams therefore appears under both.
- **Public-surface abuse controls:** the `/slots` endpoint is rate-limited (60/min/IP,
  `slotsRL`) and `POST /v1/bookings` (20/min/IP, `bookingRL`); a per-email hourly cap
  (`maxBookingsPerEmailPerHour`) backstops rotating-IP spam; and the booking form has a
  hidden **honeypot** (`company`) that rejects bots. Booker email *verification* is
  intentionally absent — it would need a pending-booking state (a deliberate non-goal).
  - **The honeypot input must give browser autofill nothing to classify.** Autofill
    fills fields it recognises by label text and `name`/`id`, and a "Company" label with
    `name="company"` made Chrome fill it from real bookers' address profiles despite
    `autocomplete="off"`, so the server rejected people as bots (#33). On
    `book.html` it has no label and a neutral `name="hp"`/`id="f-hp"`; the embed
    widget's has no label, name or id at all. Only the JSON field is called `company`.
    `TestBookPage_honeypotGivesAutofillNothingToClassify` holds the rendered markup to
    that.
- **Cancel:** `CancelBooking` (admin) and `CancelByToken` (manage link) share
  `Handler.cancelSideEffects` — loops `booking_hosts`, cancels each host's calendar
  event by its stored id, notifies each host + the attendee (attendee "With:" = the
  primary host), fires the webhook. On a successful delete it **clears
  `external_event_id`** (matching the reconciler) so the freed slot is immediately
  re-offerable and own-event exclusion stops treating it as ours.
- **Reschedule:** `RescheduleBooking` (admin) + `RescheduleByToken` share
  `moveCalendarEvents` — `Service.UpdateEvent` moves **every** assigned host's event to
  the new time. The overlap re-check covers **all** the booking's hosts, not just
  the primary.
- **Reassign:** `ReassignHost` swaps the primary host (archive/resolve flow), moves
  the calendar event old→new, and keeps `booking_hosts` in sync so later
  cancel/notify fan-out targets the right person.

Side effects are **best-effort** (a mail/calendar failure must not roll back the
committed booking) — which is why the reconciler (§11) exists.

## 10. Calendar integration (provider abstraction)

The connected-provider lookup prefers the destination connection. A conflict-only connection must not select the provider used when deciding how to generate a meeting link.
Availability checks return an error if any selected conflict calendar cannot be checked. Partial provider responses and unreadable busy periods are not treated as free time. An unavailable calendar can therefore temporarily prevent booking; reconnect it or deselect it from conflict checks to restore availability.
Bookings also check pending local bookings owned by other accounts that use the same selected conflict calendar. This check runs inside the booking transaction, before asynchronous calendar creation can finish. Calendar identity currently includes the provider, account email, and calendar ID. ⚠️ On PostgreSQL the transaction holds the advisory lock of the booking's own host only, so two hosts that share a calendar are not serialised against each other by it.

Calnode talks to calendars through a **provider abstraction**, not a single vendor:

- **`internal/calendar`** defines the `Provider` interface (Name, InvitesGuests,
  AuthURL/EncryptState/Exchange, Connected/Disconnect/HasDestination, FreeBusy,
  CreateEvent/UpdateEvent/CancelEvent) and a **`Service`** that dispatches per-user:
  it reads `calendar_connections.provider` for the user and routes the call to the
  right backend. Booking/slot/reconciler code talks only to `*calendar.Service` —
  never a concrete provider.
- **Providers:** `internal/gcal` (Google) and `internal/calendar/microsoft`
  (Microsoft 365 / Outlook via Graph). Both implement `Provider`. One `Service` is
  built at startup (`internal/server`) and each configured backend is `Register`ed.
- **One calendar per user.** On a successful connect the callback calls
  `Service.RetainOnly(userID, provider)`, deleting any prior connection on a
  different provider — so connecting Microsoft replaces a previous Google connection
  and vice versa.
- `calendar_connections` holds per-user OAuth tokens (encrypted), the `provider`,
  connection roles `is_destination` / `check_conflicts`, and **`account_kind`**
  (migration 00032 — `work`|`personal`|`""`). Token refresh is automatic via an
  oauth2 `TokenSource` wrapped by a `savingTokenSource` that persists refreshed
  tokens (and preserves `account_kind`, which a refresh has no id_token to re-derive).

**Per-provider notes.**
- *Google* (`internal/gcal`): Meet via `conferenceData.createRequest` +
  `conferenceDataVersion=1` (returns `hangoutLink`); `CancelEvent` treats 410 Gone as
  success; `sendUpdates=all`. Free/busy via the freebusy API.
- *Microsoft* (`internal/calendar/microsoft`): Graph `/me/events`; Teams via
  `isOnlineMeeting:true, onlineMeetingProvider:"teamsForBusiness"` → `onlineMeeting.joinUrl`;
  free/busy via `/me/calendarView`. **`account_kind` is captured at connect** from the
  id_token `tid` claim (the consumers tenant `9188040d-…` ⇒ `personal`, else `work`) —
  added via the `openid` scope. A blanket `404 MailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI` on every
  `/me/*` call means the account has **no Exchange Online mailbox** (not an auth error).
  Graph errors log their response body to make this self-evident.
- *CalDAV* (`internal/caldav`): username + app password over Basic auth, connected through
  `POST /v1/calendar/caldav/connect`, which walks `current-user-principal` →
  `calendar-home-set` → a Depth 1 listing and binds the account's default collection
  (`calendar_connections.calendar_id`). **A calendar id is the collection URL**, so the picker,
  free/busy and write-back all address collections directly. `ListCalendars` repeats that walk
  from the bound collection with the stored credentials (the server URL typed at connect is not
  stored; a server that reports no principal there gets the collection's parent) and lists
  every VEVENT-capable collection under the home, with `Writable` read from
  `DAV:current-user-privilege-set` (`all`, `write`, `write-content` or `bind`; not reported
  counts as writable). **A collection on a different origin (scheme, host, port) from the home
  is skipped**, at connect and when listing, because a stored id is sent the account's
  credentials on every read and write. When that leaves connect with no event calendar at all
  (typically a reverse proxy whose upstream reports its internal scheme or host in hrefs), it
  fails naming both addresses rather than with "no writable calendar found". CalDAV implements
  `calendar.SelectionValidator` (below). Free/busy REPORTs each calendar ticked for conflicts
  (`ConflictCalendarIDs`) and makes no discovery requests; an account that never saved a
  selection reads only its bound collection. A 401/403 wraps `calendar.ErrReauthRequired`, so
  a revoked app password shows as "needs reconnecting" in the picker.
  **Listing never leaves the bound collection's origin.** It runs on every picker load and
  every saved selection, with the account's credentials, against hrefs the server chooses, so
  `homeForCalendar` does not follow a principal or calendar home on another origin (it lists the
  bound collection's parent instead), `propfind` is pinned to that origin and refuses a redirect
  off it, and `ListCalendars` drops any collection off it. Connect-time discovery is not pinned:
  it starts from a URL the user typed, and can legitimately cross hosts (iCloud's calendar home
  is on a per-account partition host). In `MULTI_TENANT` mode every listing request dials
  through the same strict guard as connect (`caldav.WithStrictSSRFGuard`), so a picker load
  cannot reach an address connect could not.

**Online-meeting links are provider-matched (`booking_handler.go`).** A
`google_meet`/`teams` event type auto-mints a link **only when the primary host's
connected provider natively matches the platform** — Meet↔Google, Teams↔work-Microsoft
(`Service.CanAutoGenerate`; personal Microsoft can't mint Teams). When it can't, we
**never fabricate a link of the wrong kind** — the organizer's manually-entered
`location_value` is used instead. The minted link is stored on
`bookings.location_value`, surfaced in emails + the manage page, and passed as the
location of secondary hosts' events. The reconciler's create path applies the same
match rule; reschedule keeps the link (same event id), reassign carries the existing
link to the new host. Created async, so the link lands in the email + booking record,
not the instant 201.

**Save-time location validation (`event_type.go` + `validateLocation`).** A location
type only saves with usable join info: Teams/Meet need an auto-capable connected
calendar **or** a valid manual link (host-checked); Zoom/Video link need a valid https
URL (Zoom host-checked); Phone needs a phone number; In-person is free-form. Enforced
on create (when location is explicit) and on update **only when location actually
changes**, so editing an unrelated field on a legacy event type never trips it. New
event types get a **smart default** location from the owner's connected calendar
(Google→Meet, work-Microsoft→Teams, else Zoom) so the common case is bookable with no
manual link.

- Multi-host: each attending host gets their own event; the per-host event id lives
  in `booking_hosts.external_event_id` (migration 00023); the primary's also on
  `bookings.external_event_id` for back-compat.

**The email `.ics` gate (easy to miss).** `Handler.noConnectedDestination` (§12) lives in
the *mailer* path, not the provider packages. It must **not** attach Calnode's `.ics`
for any provider that auto-invites attendees (Google ✓, Microsoft Graph ✓) or
recipients get a *duplicate* invite; the gate keys on `Service.InvitesGuests`. Plain
CalDAV without iTIP scheduling (RFC 6638) does **not** auto-invite, so a future CalDAV
provider would want the `.ics` — the rule is "no destination whose provider
auto-delivers invites," not "no Google."

**Adding another provider (Apple/iCloud, CalDAV):** implement `calendar.Provider`,
register it in `internal/server`, set `InvitesGuests()` correctly (drives the `.ics`
gate above), and extend `providerMintsPlatform`/`CanAutoGenerate` if it offers a
native meeting platform.

### Which calendar a booking is written to

Two layers, and they are easy to confuse:

- `calendar_connections.is_destination` picks the **account**.
- `connection_calendars.is_destination` picks the **calendar inside that account**
  (`connstore.DestinationCalendarID`). Empty means "use the account's default", which is
  every install until someone actively chooses otherwise.

Each provider applies the choice where its own write target lives: Google and CalDAV swap
the calendar id (for CalDAV that id *is* the collection URL); Microsoft posts to
`/me/events`, which is the default calendar by definition, so a chosen calendar means a
different URL (`/me/calendars/{id}/events`). Graph's update/delete address an event by id
across all calendars, so only creation is calendar-scoped there.

Saving a sub-calendar destination also moves the account-level destination to that account,
or the choice silently does nothing when the picked calendar lives in a different account
from the current destination.

**Where a calendar id says where credentials go, a saved selection is checked first.** A
provider implementing `calendar.SelectionValidator` (CalDAV, whose id is a collection URL that
free/busy and bookings authenticate to) is asked to accept every id before
`SetAccountCalendars` opens its transaction. A refused id is `*UnknownCalendarError` (400 from
`PUT .../calendars`) and nothing is saved; a failure to check is `ErrCalendarList` (502) or a
reauth error (409), as on the GET. Google and Microsoft do not implement it: their ids are
names inside an API the account's token already scopes, so saving there stays a local write
with no provider call, and aliases such as Google's `"primary"` still save.

**`booking_hosts.external_calendar_id` records where each event actually went** (migration
00055). Reschedule and cancel use it rather than re-resolving the current destination -
otherwise changing the destination orphans every existing booking: the provider 404s, the
booking cancels in Calnode, and the meeting stays on the host's calendar with nothing
surfaced. Empty means "resolve the old way", correct for bookings that predate the column.
Known limit (Google, Microsoft): this rescues a change of calendar *within* an account, not
a move to a different account, which would need the account recorded too.

CalDAV does not have that limit, because its event id is the event's absolute URL and so
already names the server. `Service.UpdateEvent`/`CancelEvent` route an id the CalDAV
provider recognizes (`calendar.EventRecognizer`) to it whatever the destination is now, and
it authenticates as the connected account that holds the event (`caldav.eventConn`), never
as the destination: the account whose bound or saved calendar is the recorded calendar id,
else whose calendar URL contains the event URL (same scheme, host and port, path under it;
most specific wins). No match, or a tie, sends nothing and returns an error. This is a
credential boundary, not a routing nicety: accounts can live on different servers, and the
destination's app password sent to an older event's URL goes to someone else's server.

That refusal matches `calendar.ErrEventUnreachable`, and the reconciler treats it as final:
it logs one warning, clears `needs_sync` (reschedule) or the event id (cancel, logged
redacted since it is the only record), and does not retry. Retrying cannot help, because it
re-reads the same connections and refuses the same way, and the cancellation sweep has no
date bound, so it would repeat forever. Any other error, such as a server that is down or
refuses the stored password, stays retryable.

---

## 11. Calendar reconciler (self-healing)

`internal/handler/calendar_reconcile.go`. Calendar side effects are best-effort and
async; a transient network failure (e.g. DNS blip) can leave the calendar diverged
from the booking with no retry. The reconciler closes that gap using `booking_hosts`
as the desired state:

- **Cancel direction:** cancelled booking with a lingering `external_event_id` →
  delete the event, null the id.
- **Create direction:** upcoming confirmed booking, host has a destination calendar,
  no event id → create it, store the id. A **5-minute grace** skips just-created
  bookings so it can't race/duplicate the inline create.
- Runs at startup, every 2 min, and on a **nudge** fired when an inline op errors.
  **Idempotent** (re-delete is a 410 no-op; create only fills gaps), so re-running
  is safe. `Service.HasDestination` avoids pointless retries for hosts with no calendar.
- **Time-drift (reschedule):** a failed inline move (`UpdateEvent`) flags the host row
  `needs_sync` (migration 00025); `reconcileReschedules` re-applies the booking's time
  to flagged events and clears the flag. So the reconciler covers create, cancel, AND
  time-drift — the last via an explicit flag, since drift can't be inferred from
  booking state without reading Google. Idempotent (re-applying the same time is a
  no-op).

---

## 12. Notifications & email

- `internal/mailer`: two transports behind one `Mailer` interface. The `From` header =
  `{EmailFromName} <{EmailFrom}>` (`smtp.go: buildRaw`). Configurable in Settings → Email
  (`email_from`, `email_from_name`) or env.
- **Two transports, chosen by credentials, not by probing** (`handler.BuildMailer`, the
  single place the decision is made - boot and the settings-save path both call it):
  - a **Resend API key** set (`resend_api_key_enc`, migration 00054) selects `resend.go`,
    which posts to `api.resend.com` over HTTPS;
  - otherwise an SMTP host selects `smtp.go`;
  - neither selects `Noop`.

  This exists because **SMTP is not universally available**: several platforms (Railway
  below Pro among them) block outbound SMTP on cheaper plans by *dropping* packets, so it
  presents as a hang and then as a credentials problem. No SMTP-layer setting can fix that.

  Selection is deliberately **not** probe-and-fallback. A startup probe tests reachability
  at boot rather than at send time, an open TCP port is not a working delivery path, and
  silently switching transports makes "which path sent this?" unanswerable while masking a
  genuinely broken SMTP config. Explicit credentials state intent. `GET /v1/settings/email`
  returns the live `transport`, and the admin UI badges it, so filled-in SMTP fields are
  never mistaken for SMTP delivery.
- **TCP relay:** `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_HOST` / `EMAIL_SMTP_CONNECT_PORT` are loaded by `internal/config` and passed through `SMTPConfig` / `BuildMailer` at boot and settings reload. They change only the dial address; TLS and authentication keep the original SMTP host. Active overrides are logged.
- **The dial must stay bounded.** `defaultSMTPTimeout` once applied only via
  `conn.SetDeadline`, which runs *after* the dial returns, leaving the dial itself bounded
  by the OS SYN-retry limit (~2 min). Against a packet-dropping host that stalls the job
  queue, which shares a single SQLite connection, so one unreachable mail server delays
  every queued email behind it. Both dialers now carry the deadline (`newDialers`).
- **`ErrUnreachable`** distinguishes "could not connect at all" from "connected, then
  rejected", so `POST /v1/settings/email/test` can name the platform-block possibility
  instead of reporting a generic failure. Both transports use it.
- **Calendar invites over the API path:** the `.ics` is attached with its full MIME type,
  `text/calendar; charset=utf-8; method=REQUEST`. The `method` parameter is what makes a
  client render an RSVP-able event rather than a file. Resend's `content_type` field is set
  explicitly for this and pinned by `TestICSAttachmentKeepsItsMethodParameter`, but their
  docs do not commit to preserving parameters verbatim - **if invites ever arrive as plain
  attachments, check this first**; the fallback is to carry the calendar part in the body.
- Email types: confirmation, cancellation, reschedule, reminder — to attendee
  and/or host, gated by per-user notification prefs. Custom per-event-type notes +
  per-event "send test".
- **HTML emails (`mailer/html.go`):** every booking email is sent
  `multipart/alternative` — a styled HTML body plus the plain-text version as the
  fallback. One shared `html/template` layout (inline styles, table layout, fixed
  light palette — no CSS vars/`<style>`/external CSS, for client compatibility)
  with a per-type "content" block cloned onto it; add-to-calendar links render as
  buttons, plus a "Manage booking"/"Book again" button. The body carries **no
  brand text** (the sender already brands it): the header is a **logo-only slot**
  shown only when a logo is set, and there's no footer. Host emails set
  `HideManageLink`. `RenderBody` returns subject+text+html (test-email path).
- **Add-to-calendar:** attendee confirmation/reschedule/reminder emails carry
  Google + Outlook "Add to Calendar" *links* (`BookingData.GoogleCalURL`/`OutlookCalURL`)
  — always safe (pull-based). **Plus a gated `.ics` invite** (`mailer/ics.go`,
  `BuildICS`): attached to both the attendee's *and* each host's confirmation/
  reschedule (`METHOD:REQUEST`) and cancellation (`METHOD:CANCEL`) emails, **gated
  per-recipient on that person's host having no connected destination calendar**
  (`Handler.noConnectedDestination`, provider-agnostic via
  `Service.HasDestination`). When a host *is* connected (Google or Microsoft), that
  provider already puts the event on their calendar and invites the booker, so
  attaching our own (different-UID) `.ics` would duplicate it; when there's no
  destination, the `.ics` is how that recipient gets the meeting on their calendar.
  Stable UID `{bookingID}@calnode` + non-decreasing `SEQUENCE` (updated_at unix) lets a
  client match the REQUEST → reschedule → CANCEL to one event. `smtp.go: buildRaw`
  nests the body in `multipart/mixed` when a message has attachments; the body
  itself is `multipart/alternative` (text+HTML) or single-part text.
- Multi-host fan-out: each assigned host gets their host-notification; the attendee
  gets one. (See §9.)
- **The host in a booking email is the booking's, never the event type's owner.**
  Name, address and notification prefs come from `bookings.host_id` (the primary host)
  or `booking_hosts`, not `event_types.user_id`: on round-robin and multi-host event
  types the owner is often not attending. The reminder worker joins on
  `bookings.host_id`; `loadCancellationData` (cancel, reschedule, reassign) takes the
  host from the `HostID` of the booking it is given. The manage page's fallback name,
  used when `booking_hosts` yields nothing, is the booking's primary host too. The
  public booking page, the embed's public event-type read and the tenant index still
  join the owner: no booking exists there, so the owner is the only host to name.
- **Per-event-type customisation:** custom note bodies (`msg_*`) and custom subject
  lines (`subj_*`, migration 00026) for the four attendee emails; a blank subject
  falls back to the built-in default (`BookingData.SubjectOverride` / `subjectOr`).
- **Branding (`branding_settings.go`, migrations 00029/00050):** instance-wide
  `business_name` + `logo_url` + `banner_url` on the singleton row. Business name is the
  wordmark fallback (defaults to "Calnode") + public-page header; the logo is the email
  header image + public-page header. `GET/PATCH /v1/settings/branding` (name + opacity
  settings only); the logo and banner are each an **upload**
  (`POST/DELETE /v1/settings/branding/logo` and `.../banner`, public serve at
  `GET /branding/logo` / `GET /branding/banner`) reusing the avatar pipeline:
  `imaging.Fit` into 600x200 (logo) or 1600x800 (banner) preserving aspect ratio (no
  crop), re-encoded PNG (keeps transparency), stored on the `/data` volume. Both URLs
  store the relative serve path with a `?v=<ts>` cache-buster; `Handler.applyBranding`
  makes them absolute for emails (relative is fine on same-origin pages). The banner is
  optional and independent of the logo (each shows or hides on its own presence),
  rendered full width below the logo on `book.html`/`manage.html` (matching `.card`'s
  860px max-width) and edge-to-edge in emails (no padding/border, unlike the logo's
  bordered header cell). Public-page CSP `img-src` allows `https:`/`data:` so the
  logo/banner load (`strictPublicCSP`). Brand is threaded into every send site
  (booking/cancel/reschedule/reassign + worker reminder).
- Reminders: scheduled as `jobs` and sent by the worker (§13).
- **Deliverability note (ops):** a transactional provider is the expected production
  path, e.g. **Resend** SMTP (`smtp.resend.com`, user `resend`, password = API key,
  STARTTLS) or its HTTPS API, with the sending domain verified so any From on it
  works. ⚠️ This used to name one specific deployment's domain, which was upstream's
  own and never this fork's. Email settings are **per-instance in
  each DB** (local ≠ prod). NB: Google/Workspace SMTP **rewrites the From** to the
  authenticated account unless it's a verified "Send mail as" alias — that's why a
  dedicated provider is used for branded From. SPF/DKIM/DMARC for the sending domain
  drive inbox placement.

---

## 13. Webhooks & background worker

- `internal/worker`: polls the `jobs` table **every 5s** (batch ≤10). Job types:
  `webhook.deliver` and `reminder.send`. Also purges expired manage tokens +
  sessions + magic-link tokens + idempotency keys (>24h old) + OAuth auth codes +
  **finished webhook deliveries (>30d, `webhookDeliveryRetention`)** each cycle, and
  reaps jobs whose 30s lock expired (crash recovery —
  reset to pending +1 min). Retry **backoff is a fixed two-step: 60s then 5 min**
  (not exponential), `max_attempts` 3. Atomic claim via
  `UPDATE … WHERE status='pending'` + RowsAffected.
- `internal/webhook`: enqueues `booking.created` / `.cancelled` / `.rescheduled` /
  `.reminder` plus the notetaker events `recording.completed` / `transcript.ready` /
  `notes.ready`
  (reference payloads — booking-shaped, keyed by id; consumers fetch the artifact body
  via REST/MCP). Deliveries are signed
  **HMAC-SHA256**, header `X-Calnode-Signature` (+ `X-Calnode-Event`/`-Delivery`),
  secret stored encrypted. The worker's HTTP client is **SSRF-guarded** (resolves
  DNS, blocks private/loopback/CGNAT/ULA IPs, dials the resolved IP to avoid
  re-resolution) since webhook URLs are user-supplied.
- **`booking.reminder`** is fired by the `reminder.send` job (`internal/worker`), booking-shaped
  like its siblings plus **`hours_before`** — an event type can configure several reminders, so
  the payload has to say which one this is. It carries no payment fields: those come from
  create/cancel, and `paymentStatusForWebhook`'s mapping lives in the handler package.
  ⛔ **Fired after the email and only on success**, because the event means "the attendee has
  been reminded". Emitting it beside a failed send would be untrue, and the job retries — which
  would deliver it twice for one reminder. Conversely an *enqueue* failure does **not** fail the
  job: the email has already gone and a retry would send a second one, so it is logged and
  dropped. `sendReminder`'s early returns (booking deleted, no longer confirmed, host has
  reminder emails off) are all "no reminder happened", so none of them fires it either.
  ⚠️ The event needs the **booking's** `host_id`, not the event type's owner — a rotation or a
  reassignment moves it, and `Enqueue` selects a subscriber's webhooks by that id.
- **Per-webhook payload fields:** each webhook chooses which fields land in the `data`
  object (`webhooks.fields` JSON, migration 00027) — incl. attendee PII + intake
  answers. NULL ⇒ the original default set (so existing webhooks are unchanged and
  never start leaking PII). The payload is enriched (`enrich`) + filtered per-webhook
  (`buildData`) at enqueue time, so each subscriber gets its own `data`. New webhooks
  default to all fields ticked (self-hoster unticks what they don't want); a
  delivery-log view (status/HTTP/attempts) is in the admin webhooks page.

---

## 14. Visibility model

- Members see **only bookings they host** — `ListByHost` matches `bookings.host_id`
  **OR** any `booking_hosts` seat, so Group/fixed non-primary attendees see meetings
  they're on (not just the ones they lead).
- Owners/admins can request the whole workspace: `GET /v1/bookings?scope=all`
  (gated on `IsAdmin`; ignored for non-admins so it can't escalate). The bookings
  page has a "My / All" toggle for admins with a Host column.

---

## 15. Frontend toolchain & conventions

Each account can set `booking_accent` in its profile. The default preserves the dark booking controls. Booking pages, management pages, and the embed widget use the event owner's color, with a contrasting text color chosen by luminance. The profile API accepts only six-digit hex colors. In this fork the hosted booking and management pages apply the accent only when it differs from the column default (`#111827`), so a host who never picked one keeps the page theme's primary (the District palette); the widget keeps the neutral ink either way.

- Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2 (adapter-static SPA), Vite 8 (Rolldown), Tailwind v4
  (`@tailwindcss/vite`), shadcn-svelte (nova style) + bits-ui, tailwind-variants 3,
  **tailwind-merge v3** (must match Tailwind v4 — v2 mis-merges v4 classes; memory
  `tailwind-merge-version`). `pnpm` only; `pnpm exec` for local bins (`pnpm dlx` has
  a Windows manifest bug).
- shadcn states styled via Tailwind `data-*` variants need `@custom-variant` remaps
  in `app.css` or they render silently unstyled — run `pnpm test:visual` after
  touching `ui/**`, `app.css`, or the theme (memory `shadcn-tailwind-variants`).
- Prefer a component's variant prop over a `class` override of its size default
  (e.g. button height) — overrides rely on tailwind-merge stripping the default.
- Control heights are compact `h-8` by default ("nova"); auth-screen CTAs use
  explicit `h-11`.

---

## 16. Deployment & control-plane direction

- Today, two shapes from one binary. **Single tenant:** `make build` (frontend then
  backend), run `./calnode`, SQLite on a volume. **Multi tenant:** the fork's
  PostgreSQL-only image (`Dockerfile.district`) with `MULTI_TENANT` set, which is what
  District AI runs in four regions. See §25.
- **The control plane is external, by decision.** `MULTI_TENANT` gives an operator's
  own platform a provisioning API, a signed session hand-off onto each workspace's
  own domain, and an off switch for the embedded console (`ADMIN_SPA=off`), rather
  than growing a control plane inside this binary. Custom domains work in both
  shapes: a workspace's `public_host` (multi-tenant) or `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
  (single-tenant) drives booker-facing links and emails, while `BASE_URL` stays the
  identity host for OAuth and admin.
- ⛔ **Instance-per-tenant is no longer the direction, and this section said it was.**
  It described managed hosting as one deployment per customer, with the multi-tenant
  question deferred. That plan was replaced: one process, many workspaces, and a
  boundary the database enforces. The foundational pieces the old note named are all
  still here and all still load-bearing (envelope encryption, the
  `BASE_URL`/`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` split, the version stamp, the readiness gate), which
  is why the plan could change without the groundwork being wasted.
- **Behind a reverse proxy (Fly / Railway / nginx) — required:** forward the
  **original `Host` header**. The CSRF same-origin check (§6) compares the request's
  `Origin`/`Referer` against `Host`, so a proxy that rewrites Host would *false-block
  admin writes* (403). Fly and Railway preserve Host by default; a hand-rolled nginx
  needs `proxy_set_header Host $host;`.
- **Per-IP rate limits (§8) key on the TCP remote address by default**, and
  `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` / `CF-Connecting-IP` are not read at all. That is not
  an oversight: those headers are client-chosen values, so believing them unconditionally
  would let anyone split their own rate-limit bucket by sending a different one each
  request. Behind a shared proxy the limit therefore keys on the proxy's connection —
  fine for a per-instance Fly/Railway deploy, worth knowing for a fronting CDN.
  **`TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`** (comma-separated CIDRs, a bare address meaning one host)
  opts in per network: for a peer inside one of those ranges, `TrustClientIP`
  (`internal/server/middleware.go`) resolves the client IP by walking `X-Forwarded-For`
  **right to left past trusted hops** and taking the first untrusted address, else the
  peer. Single-value vendor headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Real-IP`, `True-Client-IP`)
  are never consulted, even from a trusted peer: the list names *networks*, not CDNs, so
  an ordinary reverse proxy in it forwards whatever the client sent, and the header
  itself carries nothing that says which hop wrote it. A CDN sets `X-Forwarded-For` too
  and its own ranges belong in the list, so the walk reaches the same visitor without
  believing a header for a reason the code cannot check. ⛔ Not the leftmost entry: the left
  of that header is whatever the original client sent, and every well-behaved proxy
  preserves it. A hop that does not parse ends the walk and falls back to the peer rather
  than being skipped, so one malformed entry cannot push the walk onto a value the client
  chose. `X-Forwarded-For` is read as **every** field line joined in order, not just the
  first, because a client's own line in front of a proxy that adds a second one would
  otherwise be the only thing the walk saw. Headers from an **untrusted** peer are never read, which is what keeps the
  default un-weakenable by a header. Resolution happens once, in the outermost
  middleware, and is carried in the request context.

---

## 17. Cross-cutting gotchas (read before editing)

1. **SQLite single connection** — never query inside an open cursor; materialize
   first (§4). Harmless on PostgreSQL, but the pattern stays either way.
   On PostgreSQL the same single connection is also what the booking overlap check
   loses, which `pg_advisory_xact_lock` replaces (§4).
2. **All times UTC** in storage; convert at the edges. The slot busy-window must be
   widened for tz boundaries.
3. **Frontend is embedded at compile time** — `pnpm build` + rebuild Go to see
   changes.
4. **Two public templates drift** — keep `book.html` and `manage.html` in sync.
5. **tailwind-merge must track Tailwind major** (§15).
6. **Calendar side effects are best-effort** — the reconciler is the safety net;
   keep ops idempotent.
7. **Booking visibility / availability key on `booking_hosts`**, not `host_id`
   alone, or multi-host attendees become invisible / double-bookable.
8. **Public-page CSP is dynamic** — `publicCSP()` (tracking_settings.go) returns the
   strict default and relaxes only when head code-injection is configured (broad
   `https:` or the operator's `tracking_csp_allow`). Don't re-hardcode the CSP on the
   `book`/`manage` handlers — route it through `publicCSP`.
9. **`FRAME_ANCESTORS` is the admin SPA's only, and it must stay that way.** Set it
   (space-separated `https://host[:port]` / `'self'`) and the handler under `/admin/`
   sends `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors <list>` so an operator can embed the
   console in their own tooling. `internal/server`'s `FrameAncestors` middleware wraps
   `frontend.Handler()` and nothing else: the public booking pages keep
   `frame-ancestors 'none'` + `X-Frame-Options: DENY` unconditionally, because they are
   unauthenticated pages collecting names, emails and card details and clickjacking one
   is worth more than framing a console nobody reaches without a session.
   ⚠️ **Unset sends no frame header at all, which is what `/admin/` has always sent** —
   the SPA is framable by default. This setting deliberately does *not* add a default
   deny, since an opt-in flag must not smuggle in a behaviour change;
   `TestAdminSPA_sendsNoFrameHeadersWhenUnset` pins the current answer so changing it is
   a decision. No `X-Frame-Options` is sent beside the CSP either: that header has no
   allow-list form (`ALLOW-FROM` is dead), so the only value it could carry is
   `SAMEORIGIN`, which browsers apply *instead of* the CSP and would break the embedding.
   An entry that isn't `https://host[:port]` or `'self'` fails `config.Validate()` and the
   process **refuses to start** — a browser drops a source list it cannot parse, so a
   typo would otherwise leave `/admin/` more embeddable than with the setting unset.
   ⛔ **The CSP is only half of what an embed needs, and the other half is not
   configurable.** `calnode_session` is `SameSite=Lax` (`session.go`), so a browser does
   not send it on a subresource request from a **cross-site** parent. A console on an
   unrelated eTLD+1 may therefore frame `/admin/` after this setting and still get the
   login screen inside the frame, forever — the header permits the embed and the cookie
   declines to authenticate it. Working embeds are same-site: `'self'`, or a parent
   sharing `BASE_URL`'s registrable domain (in multi-tenant mode, the workspace's
   `public_host`, which is where `/admin/` and its cookie live). Relaxing that means `SameSite=None; Secure`
   on the session cookie, which removes the CSRF protection the `Lax` default provides
   for every other route, so it is deliberately not offered as a setting.

---

## 18. Known gaps / deferred

- **Multi-host archiving interplay** — archive guard / upcoming-bookings / reassign
  count only the primary `host_id`; archiving a member who is a non-primary
  required/fixed host on upcoming bookings isn't blocked. **Accepted limitation**
  (degrades gracefully; offboarding is deliberate).
- **BIMI/avatar** for outbound email — not settable via headers; needs DMARC
  enforcement + a VMC if ever wanted.
- **Teams on personal Microsoft accounts** — `teamsForBusiness` is work/school only,
  so a personal Microsoft account can't auto-mint Teams links; the organizer must
  supply a manual link (validated, and surfaced in the editor hint).
- **The admin SPA does not lay out below ~600px.** On the settings pages the nav and the
  content sit in one flex row with no stacking breakpoint, so the content column is
  squeezed to near-zero width and text wraps into a tall vertical sliver. Measured on
  Settings → Profile at a 535px viewport: the `mx-auto max-w-4xl px-8` shell reported a
  151px client width and the form column 0. Affects every settings page, not one
  component, so the fix is a breakpoint in the settings shell rather than per-page
  patching. The **public** booking surfaces are unaffected and are verified on mobile;
  this is admin-only. Deferred 2026-08-22, not a regression.
- **LiveKit room is not translated** - the booking surfaces, emails and calendar invites
  ship in 9 languages (§23), but the in-browser meeting UI is ~45 hardcoded English
  strings. It has its own vanilla-JS asset pipeline and shares no string plumbing with
  the Go templates, so it needs a small runtime `t()` of its own. Separate work, not hard.
- **Plural rules are 2-form only** (§23) - shipping Polish, Russian or Arabic correctly
  needs a real CLDR plural-category selector first.
- **OAuth app verification** — the Google and Microsoft apps should go through
  publisher verification before wide public use to avoid "unverified app" warnings.

## 19. MCP server (agent interface)

A Model Context Protocol server is compiled into the binary on the official Go SDK
(`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk`). `Handler.MCPServer()`
(`internal/handler/mcp.go`) builds one server instance exposing eight typed tools
(schema generated from Go structs): `list_event_types`, `get_event_type`,
`get_available_slots`, `create_booking`, `get_booking`, `reschedule_booking`,
`cancel_booking`, `list_bookings`. `list_bookings` filters (`status`, `date_from`,
`date_to`, `event_type_id` as a slug, `host_id`, `team_id`) and pages (`limit`,
`offset`, with `total` in the result) through the same SQL path as the REST list
(§9) - it used to load everything and filter the slice in Go.
`get_event_type` returns an event type's intake
**questions** (required flags + options) + hosts so an agent can supply valid answers
to `create_booking` — without it the booking tools are subtly unreliable for event
types that have required questions.

- **Two transports, one server:**
  - **stdio** — the `calnode mcp` subcommand (`cmd/calnode/mcp.go`) boots the full
    stack via `server.BuildHandler` (the service-wiring half of `server.New`, factored
    out so both paths share it) and runs over `mcp.StdioTransport`. Logs go to
    **stderr** — stdout is the JSON-RPC stream.
  - **Streamable HTTP** — mounted at `POST /mcp` in `server.New` via
    `mcp.NewStreamableHTTPHandler`, wrapped in `RequireAuth` (API-key path is the
    intended caller; the session path stays same-origin-guarded). No SSE.
- **No parallel code path.** Tools call the same internal services as the REST
  handlers. The shared cores: `computeSlots` (slot generation, also behind `GetSlots`),
  `validateAnswersCore` (intake-answer validation, behind `validateAnswers`),
  `resolveBookingHostPool` (routing-mode host split), and the side-effect dispatchers
  `dispatchBookingConfirmation` / `rescheduleSideEffects` / `cancelSideEffects`. So an
  MCP booking fires calendar events, emails, webhooks, and reminders identically to a
  web booking.
- **Scope:** the management tools are **role-scoped** to mirror the REST model —
  `MCPCallerMiddleware` (after `RequireBearerToken`) binds the user+role to the request
  context, and the tools branch on it: members see/act on only bookings they host
  (`ListByHost`, host-scoped `Cancel`), admins/owner get the whole workspace
  (`ListAll`/`CancelByID`). The stdio transport has no bound caller → full access (local
  operator). `list_event_types`/`get_available_slots`/`create_booking` are the public
  booking surface (unscoped). Tools translate between the slug they expose as
  `event_type_id` and the internal booking id. Gap: `create_booking` does not yet honour
  an `idempotency_key` (REST-only).
- **Authorization — the "Connect" flow** (`mcp_oauth.go`, `mcp_oauth_authorize.go`):
  Calnode is its own **OAuth 2.1 authorization server** for the `/mcp` resource, so an
  agent (Claude, ChatGPT) adds the server by URL and clicks **Connect** instead of
  pasting a key.
  - `/mcp` is guarded by `auth.RequireBearerToken(VerifyMCPBearer)`; a `401` advertises
    `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728), which points at the AS metadata
    `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414).
  - Clients self-register at `POST /oauth/register` (RFC 7591 DCR; public PKCE clients).
    `GET/POST /oauth/authorize` checks for a Calnode session — if absent it bounces
    through the **existing Google/Microsoft login** (via a `post_login_redirect` cookie
    that `finishOAuthLogin` honours) and back to a **consent** screen. `POST /oauth/token`
    does PKCE-S256-verified `authorization_code` and rotating `refresh_token` grants.
  - Tokens are opaque, **SHA-256-hashed** in `oauth_access_tokens` (migration 00033);
    `VerifyMCPBearer` accepts either an OAuth access token or a `cno_` API key, so
    scripted callers keep working. The worker purges expired `oauth_auth_codes`.
  - The slick Connect UX needs the server on **HTTPS** with valid metadata (deployed
    instance); `http://localhost` works for stdio/manual testing but not the remote
    connector UI.
  - **Connected apps** admin page (`/connections`, `GET`/`DELETE /v1/oauth/connections`)
    lists the grants a user authorized and revokes one (deletes the token → immediate
    loss of `/mcp` access). Per-user scoped, like API keys.
    The page also surfaces the connector URL itself (`<origin>/mcp`) with a copy button -
    it previously listed grants without ever saying how to create one. The URL is built
    from `window.location.origin`, not a configured `BASE_URL`: whatever host the admin
    reached the page on is by definition resolvable, whereas a configured value can be
    stale or internal. Copy failure is surfaced explicitly, because `navigator.clipboard`
    is unavailable outside a secure context and a self-hosted instance on plain http is
    exactly that case.

**MCP surface — design decision (2026-06-22).** The MCP intentionally exposes only the
**booking lifecycle** (discover → slots → book → view/list/reschedule/cancel), not
Calnode's full ~88-endpoint surface. Event-type CRUD, availability rules/overrides,
members/teams, calendar connections, webhooks, branding/email/tracking settings, and
key/connection management are **deliberately not exposed**. Rationale: every tool we
open is additional attack surface and agent-confusion surface, and must be kept
role-safe across transports — so we don't open capabilities just because we can. We
will **revisit and reassess in the near future once there's evidence of demand**; the
likely first expansion (per the PRD's AI roadmap) is **availability** (read +
natural-language set), then event-type creation. When we do expand, prefer narrow,
purpose-built tools over a generic "call any endpoint" tool.

**Roles & permissions — design decision (2026-06-22).** Roles are **fixed**
(owner / admin / member) with hard-coded capabilities, enforced identically across the
REST API, the admin UI, and the MCP tools. Configurable RBAC (a per-role permission
matrix the owner edits) was **deliberately deferred** — it's the industry norm to ship
fixed roles, the PRD scopes "advanced RBAC" to a later paid add-on, and a matrix would
multiply the enforcement/test surface across three call sites (a misconfiguration =
privilege escalation). The role-scoping is forward-compatible: tools compute
"can this user do X" from the bound caller's role (`mcpCallerScope`), so a future config
layer would change only *how* that's computed, not the call sites. If a real need
appears, prefer a few **targeted toggles** (e.g. "members may connect agents", "members
see team-wide bookings") over a general matrix.

---

## 20. LLM layer (conversational booking)

Optional, off by default, configured like SMTP (PRD §8.11). The core stays LLM-free; AI
is purely additive and degrades gracefully — if it's off or unreachable, every surface
falls back to the deterministic slot picker.

- **Provider config** (`internal/llm`, `llm_settings.go`, migrations 00034/00035): a
  dependency-free client for any **OpenAI-compatible** chat-completions endpoint —
  `{endpoint, model, api_key}` stored on `server_settings` (key encrypted), set in
  **Settings → AI** with a test-connection ping. Provider/model are config, not code.
  `Handler.getLLM()` returns nil when off. Verified live with **MiniMax M3**.
- **Conversational booking** (`booking_assistant.go`): `POST /v1/event-types/{slug}/assistant`
  runs an LLM **tool-loop scoped to one event type** — the model drives `find_available_slots`
  (→ `computeSlots`) and `book` (→ `createBookingForSlug`, the same creation core as MCP/REST).
  Key invariants: the LLM does **NL → constraints + ranking, never time arithmetic** (the
  deterministic engine computes availability); it **never sees raw calendar data** — only
  computed windows + public config (privacy by construction); name/email + a booker confirm
  are required before `book` commits. Reasoning models' inline `<think>` is stripped; the
  prompt enforces brevity. Public + anonymous, so it's rate-limited (15/min/IP) with
  conversation/iteration/token caps.
- **Streaming:** replies stream token-by-token. `llm.ChatStream` parses the provider's SSE;
  the endpoint content-negotiates — `Accept: text/event-stream` runs the tool-loop with
  ChatStream and emits `{token|status|done|fallback}` SSE events (`<think>` stripped on the
  fly), while other callers keep the one-shot JSON path. (Gotcha: the request-logging
  `responseWriter` embeds the RW interface, which doesn't promote `Flush` — it has an
  explicit flush-transparent `Flush()` so streamed responses aren't buffered.)
- **Admin instructions:** the base prompt (`assistantBaseRules`) is **code-owned** (the
  tool-calling contract + safety) and not editable; admins append free-text **"Additional
  instructions"** (tone/business context) shown alongside a read-only view of the base.
- **UI surfaces:** a floating launcher → **drawer** plus a subtle inline **"Book by chat"**
  link on the booking page (`book.html`), and the **inline link only** on the embed widget
  (`embed.js`) — no global floating button there, to avoid colliding with the host site's
  own widgets. Shared `.asst-*` styles live in `booking.css`; `/booking.css` is
  **content-hash cache-busted** (`?v=`) on the page `<link>` tags so CSS edits ship without
  a stale-cache wait. The **manage page is deliberately excluded** — it's reschedule/cancel
  context, and conversational AI's payoff is first-booking acquisition (a reschedule chat is
  deferred until there's demand evidence).

## 21. Payments (Stripe) — paid bookings

Optional, off by default, configured in **Settings → Payments** (one Stripe account per
instance — instance-per-tenant, so no Connect/marketplace logic; the workspace keeps 100%).
`internal/stripe` is a dependency-free client: Checkout Session create, session fetch, refund,
and webhook signature verification (HMAC-SHA256 over `t.payload`, constant-time, 5-min tolerance).

- **Price** is per event type (`price_cents` + `currency`; 0 = free → today's flow untouched).
  A price can't be saved unless Stripe is configured.
- **Pay-then-book with a held slot.** The booking is created as a normal `confirmed` row so the
  existing double-booking guard reserves the slot, but with `payment_status='pending'` and all
  confirmation side-effects **deferred**. (A separate `payment_status` column avoids a SQLite
  rebuild of the `bookings.status` CHECK.) The booker is redirected to Stripe Checkout.
- **Webhook confirms.** `POST /v1/stripe/webhook` (public, signature-authenticated) handles
  `checkout.session.completed` → `confirmPaidBooking` flips `pending→paid` (idempotent via a
  conditional UPDATE), records the charged amount, and **dispatches side-effects in the
  background** (acks in <200ms, well under Stripe's retry window). `checkout.session.expired`
  (+ a 45-min worker backstop) releases unpaid holds, freeing the slot.
- **Refund on cancel** for paid bookings — fires from the shared `cancelSideEffects`, so admin,
  manage-link, and MCP cancels all refund.
- **Surfaced everywhere:** `payment_status`/`amount_paid_cents`/`amount_paid_currency` ride on
  `booking.Booking` → REST (`GET` single + list), MCP (`get_booking`/`list_bookings`), and the
  webhook payload (default fields, omitempty so free bookings are unchanged); a `$` chip in the
  admin bookings list; price on the booking page + embed; and `value`/`currency`/`is_paid`/
  `transaction_id` in the dataLayer conversion event (free + paid paths). Agents/assistant can't
  pay, so paid events are rejected on the shared booking core (Checkout is booking-page only).

## 22. Built-in video meetings (LiveKit)

Self-hostable video as a booking **location type** (`event_types.location_type = "livekit"`),
backed by a LiveKit server (Cloud or self-hosted — same config in Settings → Video). Deliberately
**SDK-free server-side**: all tokens are hand-signed HS256/HMAC, so there's no Go SDK to vendor.
The browser room is **vanilla JS + a vendored client SDK** (`assets/livekit-client.umd.min.js`),
not part of the Svelte SPA.

**Pieces.** `internal/livekit/` — `livekit.go` (token signing/verifying), `admin.go` (Twirp admin
API + Egress, `DeleteRoom`/`UpdateParticipant`/`ListParticipants`/`UpdateRoomMetadata`/egress).
`internal/handler/livekit_room.go` (token exchange, host auth, host-control endpoints) +
`livekit_recording.go` (record start/stop, recordings list/download, webhook sink). Room UI =
`templates/livekit-room.html` + `assets/livekit-room.js` (both `go:embed`-ed in the handler pkg —
a Go rebuild is needed after editing them, independent of the SPA build).

**Three token kinds (do not conflate):**
1. **Room token** — opaque HMAC blob (`{r:room, e:exp, role}`) embedded in the booking's join URL.
   No LiveKit grant, so the API secret never ships to the browser and the link can't be replayed
   past the booking window. Signed/verified with the per-instance `roomKey`.
2. **Access token** — the real LiveKit HS256 JWT (video grants) the SDK joins with; minted on
   demand by the token-exchange endpoint. `VerifyAccessToken` re-checks it server-side for the host
   model below.
3. **Admin token** — short-lived HS256 JWT (room-scoped or server-level grant) for Twirp calls.

**Host authority — `authorizeHost`, the key invariant.** Two booking links exist (attendee +
host). A host action is authorized if the caller is **either**:
- the **durable host** (`hostRoomOrOwner`) — holds a host *room token*, OR is the signed-in booking
  owner (so an owner who opened the attendee link still drives the meeting); **or**
- the **current reassigned host** — proven by verifying their *access token* (`VerifyAccessToken`)
  and confirming that identity currently has `metadata="host"` via `ListParticipants`.

Clients therefore send **both** `t` (room token) and `at` (access token) on every host call.
Reassignment only flips a participant's metadata; without the access-token path a temp host would
have the badge but no server-side power — `authorizeHost` is what closes that. **Reclaim host is
durable-host-only** (a temp host can never reclaim). **Single host:** any host join calls
`demoteOtherHosts` (metadata→`"attendee"`); clients downgrade only on the explicit `"attendee"`,
never on a transient/empty metadata event.

**Recording (Egress).** Room-composite egress → the **Litestream backups bucket** (`LITESTREAM_*`
env), `recordings/` prefix; rows in a `recordings` table (status `active`→`complete`/`failed`,
`object_key` set at **start**). **Finalization does not depend on the webhook**:
`finalizeActiveRecording` stops the egress and marks the row complete on RecordStop / EndRoom /
host-leave; a startup sweep closes orphaned `active` rows (so a stuck row can't block re-recording
in a reused room). Downloads are presigned SigV4 GETs (`s3presign.go`). The webhook only *enriches*
(accurate duration, file-ready confirmation).

**Webhook — single sink.** LiveKit allows one webhook URL per project, so `POST
/v1/livekit/webhook` (`LiveKitWebhook`; legacy alias `/v1/livekit/egress-webhook`) receives **every**
project event. Each is signature-verified (`VerifyWebhook`, API key/secret); we act only on
`egress_started/ended/failed` (banner flag + finalize row) and `room_finished` (stop a straggling
egress), and 200-ACK + drop the rest (`room_started`, `participant_*`, `track_*`, …). The **egress
lifecycle is the source of truth** for the recording banner flag, so the indicator self-heals
regardless of which path started/stopped it. *Lifecycle events (attendance, duration) are received
but not yet persisted — see PRD Phase 4.*

**Shared room state = metadata.** Room metadata is one JSON blob `{recording, allowShare}`, pushed
to all clients via LiveKit's `RoomMetadataChanged`. **Always `mergeRoomMeta` (read-merge-write)** —
overwriting would clobber the other flag. The recording banner is an in-room overlay, hidden by
`showOnly` off the room view. Attendee screen-share defaults **off**, enforced via
`canPublishSources` (token mint + live `UpdateParticipant`), not just UI-hidden.

**Deferred:** notetaker/transcription (`calnode-notetaker` agent dispatch → transcript callback →
LLM summary) — the next build; consent-gated (§8.11/§15 of the PRD).

## 23. Languages (i18n)

This ships **9 locales**: `en` (source) · `es` · `fr` · `fr-CA` · `de` · `it` · `pt` · `nl` · `sv`.

`fr-CA` is the first **regional** locale, and it is a separate file rather than a fallback
because the differences are real: `courriel` not `e-mail`, `reporter`/`report` not
`reprogrammer`/`reprogrammation`, `renseignements personnels` never `données personnelles`
(the Quebec statutory term), no space before `!` `?` `;` where France puts one, and CLDR
itself disagrees on one abbreviation — `month_short_jul` is `juill.` in fr-CA and `juil.` in
fr, which is exactly what `TestDateTablesMatchCLDR` exists to catch. Both keep the 24-hour
clock and the day-month `date_format`. Currency and percent take a non-breaking space before
`$` and `%` in Canadian French; no key carries either today, so the rule is recorded here
rather than applied. A visitor sending `fr-FR` or plain `fr` is unaffected — the matcher
picks the exact tag first (pinned in `TestResolve`).

### What is translated, and what is not

Translation covers the surfaces a **booker** sees. It deliberately stops there.

| Surface | Translated? |
|---|---|
| Booking page (`book.html`) | yes |
| Manage page (`manage.html`) - reschedule/cancel | yes |
| Embed widget (`embed.js`) | yes |
| The four emails (confirm / cancel / reschedule / reminder) | yes |
| Calendar invite title + description | yes |
| Conversational booking assistant | yes (replies in the visitor's language) |
| **Admin SPA** (`frontend/`) | **no** - English only, by design |
| **LiveKit room** (`livekit-room.html` + `livekit-room.js`) | **no** - see below |
| **Admin-authored content** (event names, descriptions, intake questions, custom email copy) | **no** - stored as the operator typed it |
| IANA timezone identifiers | no - shown as `Europe/Berlin`, not localized |

**The LiveKit room is the one real hole.** ~45 strings in the in-browser meeting UI
(join/leave, mute, screen share, recording banner, consent prompts, chat) are hardcoded
English. It was excluded because the room is vanilla JS with its own asset pipeline
(`go:embed`-ed in the handler package, not the SPA build) and shares no template or string
plumbing with the booking surfaces, so it needs its own small runtime `t()` rather than a
reuse of `{{call .T}}`. Not hard; just genuinely separate work. Tracked in §18.

Admin-authored content is a deliberate non-goal, not an oversight: an operator serving a
German market writes their event descriptions in German, and a German visitor then gets a
coherent page. The mismatch only shows for an operator serving several languages at once,
which per-locale content overrides would solve if it is ever asked for.

### How a locale is resolved

Per request, in `internal/handler/i18n.go`, highest priority first:

1. `?lang=<code>` override (the footer language switcher sets this)
2. `Accept-Language`, negotiated with `golang.org/x/text/language`'s matcher - so
   `de-AT` resolves to `de`, and a list like `ja;q=0.9,es;q=0.5` falls through to Spanish
   rather than giving up
3. The operator's **fallback language** setting (Settings → Branding), used only when
   *nothing* matched. `confidence == language.No` is what separates "no match" from a
   weak-but-real match; a real match is never overridden by the fallback
4. English

The booker's resolved locale is **persisted on the booking** (`booking_attendees.locale`,
migration 00051) so that later emails - reminders, cancellations, the reschedule notice -
arrive in the language they booked in, not the language of whoever triggered the send.
Host-facing sends deliberately pass a nil locale and stay English.

Pages that vary on this send `Vary: Accept-Language, Cookie`; the public event-type JSON
endpoint adds it with `Header().Add` so it does not clobber the CORS middleware's
`Vary: Origin`.

### Adding a language is adding one file

`internal/i18n/locales/<code>.json`. That is the whole change - no Go, no template, no
frontend edit. `init()` globs the directory, and the language switcher, the fallback-language
dropdown, and the public API payload all read `SupportedLocales()`. This was verified by
adding six locales at once without touching code.

Go's stdlib has **no locale data**, so anything a `time` format string would normally give
you is a key in the JSON instead (`internal/i18n/datetime.go`): `date_format`, `clock_format`,
`dow_short_*`, `month_short_*`. That also makes per-language date shape expressible - German
carries its own `date_format` for the ordinal period ("Mo, 22. Jun 2026").

Three guards police a new file (`go test ./internal/i18n/`):

- `TestAllLocalesHaveTheSameKeys` - no missing or unknown keys.
- `TestAllLocalesHaveMatchingFormatVerbs` - uses `fmt` **itself** as the oracle, so a locale
  that drops or reorders a `%s`/`%d` fails the test instead of emitting `%!(EXTRA…)` to a
  booker. An earlier hand-rolled parser for this was unsound (it missed indexed verbs like
  `%+[2]d`); do not reintroduce one.
- `TestDateTablesMatchCLDR` - shells out to `node` and compares every `dow_short_*`,
  `month_short_*` and `clock_format` against `Intl`, skipping if node is absent. This is the
  only check that can tell `dim.` from `dim`, or catch a 12h/24h call that is wrong for the
  language. It caught a real drift on first run (`es` had `sep` where CLDR says `sept`).

Two traps:

- **Filenames must be BCP-47 canonical.** `pt-br.json` is wrong - `language.Make("pt-br")`
  canonicalizes to `pt-BR`, and the mismatch used to return a nil `*Locale` for an exact
  match. Fixed and regression-tested, but name the file correctly anyway.
- **Tests use `ja`/`ko` to mean "a language we do not ship."** If you ever add one,
  `assertUnsupported` / `requireUnsupported` fail loudly and name the fixture to change.
  That guard exists because `fr`/`de` used to play that role and silently became wrong the
  day those languages shipped.

### Translation quality

**Every non-English locale is an LLM draft with no native review.** The structure is
verified by the guards above; the *wording* is not. Register was chosen per language rather
than uniformly (`fr`/`de`/`it`/`pt` formal, `es`/`nl`/`sv` informal), matching what business
booking pages do in each market, but that too is unreviewed. Corrections via PR are welcome
and are the expected path to improving them. Do not describe a language as production-quality
in marketing copy without a speaker reading the booking page, the manage page, and the four
emails end to end.

### Known limitations

- **Plurals are 2-form only** (`duration_hour_one` / `duration_hours`). Languages with
  richer CLDR plural categories (Polish, Russian, Arabic) need a real plural-rule selector
  before they can ship correctly.
- **`clock_format` is a boolean, not a pattern**, so "14:30 Uhr" or "14時30分" are not
  expressible - only 12h vs 24h.
- **No RTL layout support** (declared out of scope).
- **No automated visual harness** for the Go-template surfaces, so per-language layout
  checks (long German compounds overflowing buttons) are manual, desktop and mobile.

## 24. Changelog

This doc tracks the code; when you change behaviour in an area above, update the
matching section in the same PR. Notable rounds:

- **2026-08-20 — Multi-language public surfaces (8 locales).** Booking page, manage page,
  embed widget, the four emails, the calendar invite and the booking assistant now render in
  `en es fr de it pt nl sv` (new §23). Locale is negotiated from `Accept-Language` with a
  `?lang=` switcher and an operator fallback setting, and is **stored on the booking**
  (migration 00051) so reminders match the language the booker used. Adding a language is
  adding one JSON file - proven by adding six at once with no code change. Go has no locale
  date data, so the date tables are keys in the JSON, cross-checked against `Intl`/CLDR by a
  node-backed test. **Not translated: the admin SPA and the LiveKit room** (§18).

- **2026-06-30 — Cookie consent + legal links + shared book/manage partials.** Native
  GA4/GTM (Settings → Tracking) is now consent-gated on book.html **and** manage.html:
  nothing loads, no `_ga*` cookies are set, until the visitor Accepts a banner
  (180-day `calnode_consent` cookie; footer "Cookie settings" reopens it; Decline
  clears `_ga*`). Operator Privacy/Terms URLs (Settings → Branding → Legal links,
  migration 00046) render in both pages' footers and from the banner. The
  operator-injected Head HTML path stays ungated (trusted code, unchanged); the embed
  widget has neither — it runs inside the customer's own site, which owns its own
  analytics/consent. Landed alongside a shared-partials refactor:
  `internal/handler/templates/_shared.html` ({{define}}s parsed into BOTH the book
  and manage template sets) now holds the consent/tracking/footer chrome, the
  `calendarGrid` partial (month-nav + day grid), and `eventMeta` (duration/location/
  price) — one source instead of copy-pasted markup. A cross-surface contract test
  (`booking_surfaces_contract_test.go`) additionally pins the structural hooks shared
  with **embed.js** (a separate vanilla-JS web component the Go partials can't reach)
  so CI fails if the three booking surfaces drift apart.

- **2026-06-25/26 — Built-in video (LiveKit).** Full subsystem (see §22): SDK-free hand-signed
  tokens, vanilla-JS room app, host controls (end-for-all, single-host reassign/reclaim, attendee
  screen-share toggle), recording (Egress→S3, finalize-on-stop + startup sweep, presigned
  downloads), single signature-verified webhook sink driving a self-healing recording banner.

- **2026-06-23 — Zoom + Stripe paid bookings.** Per-host Zoom OAuth (meeting links minted under
  the assigned host's account; a meeting-link provider, independent of the calendar).
  Stripe pay-then-book (held slot → Checkout → webhook-confirm → refund-on-cancel); payment is
  first-class across REST/MCP/webhooks/tracking. New §21.

- **2026-06-22 — LLM layer (conversational booking).** Optional BYO-LLM (OpenAI-compatible,
  off by default; Settings → AI). Public `…/assistant` tool-loop over the deterministic
  cores (no raw calendar data; LLM doesn't do time math); floating drawer + inline link on
  book.html, inline link on the embed widget; admin "Additional instructions" over a
  code-owned base prompt; `<think>` strip; booking.css content-hash cache-busting. Manage
  page intentionally excluded. New §20.

- **2026-06-22 — Native MCP server + OAuth "Connect".** A Model Context Protocol
  server compiled into the binary (official Go SDK) with 10 tools over **stdio**
  (`calnode mcp`) and **Streamable HTTP** (`/mcp`) — the 8 booking-lifecycle tools plus
  `get_meeting_notes`/`get_transcript` (notetaker outputs, host-scoped read-only); tools reuse the REST services via
  extracted shared cores (no parallel code path). Calnode is its own **OAuth 2.1 AS**
  (discovery + DCR + PKCE auth-code/refresh + consent reusing the existing SSO login;
  migration 00033) so agents connect by URL + click Connect; a `cno_` API key still
  works. Tools are **role-scoped** (members → own bookings only). **Connected apps**
  admin page (`/connections`) to revoke grants. Fixed roles kept; configurable RBAC
  deferred (see the design note above). New §19. Fixes this round: RFC 9207 `iss` on
  the auth response, and consent-page `form-action` CSP must allow the client redirect
  origin (else the post-consent redirect to the client is blocked).
- **2026-06-21 — Microsoft 365 + multi-provider calendar.** A **calendar provider
  abstraction** (`internal/calendar` `Provider` + `Service`), the **Microsoft 365 /
  Outlook** provider (Graph free/busy, create/reschedule/cancel, **Teams** links),
  **multi-tenant + personal** Microsoft support (`MICROSOFT_TENANT=common`),
  **work/personal account-kind** detection (id_token `tid`, migration 00032),
  **provider-matched** meeting-link generation with manual fallback, **save-time
  location validation** for every type + smart default + picker reorder, and
  **Microsoft OAuth sign-in** (`/v1/auth/microsoft/*`, identity-only). Touched §3,
  §4, §6, §10. Known constraint: Teams auto-links need a work account (§18).

## 25. Multi-tenant mode

The fork's mode, and the reason this repository exists separately from upstream.
Set `MULTI_TENANT` and one process serves many isolated workspaces; leave it unset
and nothing below is reachable.

- **PostgreSQL only, two roles, two DSNs.** `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` is the platform
  role (schema owner, `BYPASSRLS`) that runs migrations, the worker's cross-tenant
  claim loop and the platform API. `DATABASE_URL` is the application role
  (`NOBYPASSRLS`, owning no table) that every request runs as. ⛔ One role for both
  means the policies are inert against the application and nothing breaks: every
  request works, and it can also read every other workspace. Startup refuses it,
  along with a non-postgres DSN (SQLite has no row-level security to express the
  isolation with) and an application role that is a superuser, bypasses, or owns a
  table (`VerifyRoles`).
- **Row-level security is the boundary.** A `workspaces` table is the tenant root,
  every tenant table carries `workspace_id` with one policy comparing it to
  `current_setting('app.workspace_id', true)`, and an unset setting matches no row,
  so an unbound statement is silently empty rather than silently global. `FORCE ROW
  LEVEL SECURITY` is deliberately not used: it would confine the table owner too,
  and single-tenant's ordinary DSN *is* the owner.
- **Binding is per statement**, not per connection: a bound handle takes a pooled
  connection, `set_config`s the workspace, runs the statement and releases it, so a
  handle is safe to copy into a goroutine that outlives its request. `Prepare` is
  refused on a bound handle, because a prepared statement is re-prepared on whatever
  connection the pool hands it and would run unbound.
- **A request's tenant comes from its `Host` or from its credential**, every route
  declares which, and a source-scanning test fails on a registration that declares
  neither. An unknown host is a 404 rather than a fallback to a default tenant.
- **The platform API** (`/v1/platform/*`, bearer `CALNODE_PLATFORM_TOKEN`, 404 when
  unset or single-tenant) provisions a workspace in one transaction and carries
  export, import, per-attendee erasure and the member/API-key routes.
- **What is not per tenant:** the data encryption key (one wrapped DEK per process),
  the OAuth app credentials, the rate-limit counters and the retention sweeps.
- **CLI subcommands** differ by what they touch: `rotate-key` and `recover-key` are
  unchanged (`crypto_keystore` is exempt from tenancy), `reset-admin` **requires
  `--workspace=<id>`** because `users` is unique on `(workspace_id, email)` and an
  unscoped `WHERE email = ?` resets every workspace that shares an address, and
  `calnode mcp` (stdio) is **refused**, because the transport carries neither a
  credential nor a Host and the tools would run on an unbound handle that matches
  nothing. The classification is data (`platformWideCLI`) with a test asserting it.
- ⚠️ **Do not prepend `workspace_id` to a `jobs` index.** `jobs` is the one table
  worked *across* tenants: the worker's claim and its crash-recovery reaper run on
  the platform handle with no workspace predicate, ordered globally by `run_at` /
  `locked_until`, and a workspace-leading index cannot serve an ordered global scan.
  The tenant-scoped copies exist and so do `idx_jobs_pending_global (run_at)` and
  `idx_jobs_running_expired_global (locked_until)` alongside them.

**Full contract: [MULTI_TENANT.md](MULTI_TENANT.md).** It covers the isolation model in
three layers, the whole environment, what a tenant credential cannot do and why per
row, route classification, the SSO hand-off, export/import/erasure, and the operator
checklist. §16 covers how the two shapes deploy.
