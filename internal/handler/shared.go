// shared is everything one process has exactly one of: the logger, the mailer,
// the hot-swappable integration clients and the mutexes guarding them, the
// configured hosts, and the demo-mode bookkeeping.
//
// It exists so Handler can be a cheap VALUE. A tenant-scoped request needs a
// handler whose db is bound to its workspace, and the only way to give 314
// methods a bound `h.db` without editing all of them is to hand them a receiver
// that differs in that field — so Handler is copied per request. A struct
// holding six sync.RWMutex cannot be copied (go vet copylocks, and rightly:
// copying a mutex copies its state), so the mutexes live behind this pointer,
// which every copy shares.
//
// Embedding it as *shared rather than naming it keeps `h.logger`, `h.mailer`,
// `h.livekitMu` and the rest compiling unchanged across the package.

	// setting read from the environment at boot, none is per workspace, and putting
	// them on the value would copy three strings per request for nothing.
	//
	// ⚠️ ssoSecret is deliberately platform-level even though the token it signs
	// carries a `wid` claim. The secret identifies the INSTANCE that minted the
	// token; the workspace is inside the payload, which is what lets one identity
	// host hand a session to any of its tenants' public hosts (D11).
	// appDB is the APPLICATION handle as server.New built it: unbound, and belonging to the
	// role the row-level-security policies constrain.
	//
	// ⛔ forWorkspace binds from THIS, never from h.db, and the difference is the whole
	// isolation guarantee on a Platform route. Platform() replaces h.db with the platform
	// handle, whose role BYPASSES RLS — so a handle derived from it with ForWorkspace binds
	// app.workspace_id and is then not FILTERED by it. A `WHERE id = 1` read through such a
	// handle matches every workspace's row and returns an arbitrary one; a write lands
	// wherever the statement says. Both are silent.
	//
	// Found by a vendor-webhook test: the hand-off from a Platform route to
