// In multi-tenant mode an AUTHENTICATED request keys on its credential, not on the
// address it came from.
//
// ⛔ The address is the right identity for an anonymous booker and the wrong one for an
// API caller. The platform's dashboard reaches every tenant host from ONE egress IP per
// region, so keyed on the address, an entire region's authenticated dashboard traffic
// shared one 20-per-minute settings budget — the busiest workspace in the region would
// have spent it on everyone else. That is exactly the failure the workspace prefix (D14)
// was added to prevent, reappearing one dimension over, and the workspace prefix does
// not help because the traffic to ONE tenant host is what shares the address.
//
// The credential is hashed rather than used raw, and it is read from the request rather
// than resolved: the limiter runs before RequireAuth and must not do a database read to
// decide whether to reject.

// credLimiterProbe drives one request through TrustClientIP + RateLimit with a caller
// identity attached. The limit is 1 per minute so the second request against a bucket is
// a 429 and nothing depends on timing.
