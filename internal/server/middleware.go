// rateLimitKey is the bucket a request counts against (D14).

// ⛔ In multi-tenant mode it is (workspace, caller), not the IP alone. Two tenants'
// bookers routinely arrive from the same address — a shared office, a corporate NAT, a
// CDN — and with one bucket the busier workspace would spend the quieter one's
// allowance, which is one tenant degrading another's service through no fault of either.
//
// ⛔ AND THE CALLER HALF IS THE CREDENTIAL WHEN THERE IS ONE, NOT THE IP. The
// address is the right identity for an anonymous booker and the wrong one for an API
// caller: the platform's dashboard reaches every tenant host from ONE egress IP per
// region, so keyed on the address, an entire region's authenticated dashboard traffic
// shared one 20-per-minute settings budget — and the busiest workspace in the region
// would have spent it on everyone else, which is the exact failure the workspace prefix
// was added to prevent, reappearing one dimension over.
//
// A SHA-256 prefix of the credential VALUE, because the limiter runs before RequireAuth
// and must not do a database read to decide whether to reject: hashing what the request
// already carries needs no lookup, and it keeps the raw bearer out of a map key that
// outlives the request. The prefix is 16 hex characters — 64 bits, far past collision
// for a per-process window map, and short enough that the key stays readable in a dump.
//
// ⚠️ It keys on the credential the caller PRESENTED, not on the user it resolves to. An
// invalid key therefore gets its own bucket rather than falling in with the anonymous
// ones, which is the safe direction (a rotated-key retry storm cannot spend a booker's
// allowance) and the cheap one. Two live keys for one user are two budgets: they are two
// callers, which is what the platform mints them as.
//
// ⚠️ The IP half — still used for anonymous requests — has to be the RESOLVED client IP,
// not the peer, or the workspace prefix makes things WORSE: behind a shared proxy every
// request from a workspace would key on the proxy's address, so one workspace would
// become one bucket and its first 20 bookers a minute would exhaust it for everyone else
// in that tenant. TrustClientIP (TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS) is what makes remoteIP the
// client's own address; without it configured, remoteIP is the peer and that half
// degrades to exactly the behaviour that existed before.
//
// The workspace comes from the Host rather than from a resolved *Workspace, for the same

// the safe direction: an attacker rotating Host values gets a bucket per value and no
