// D14: in multi-tenant mode a rate-limit bucket is (workspace, client IP), not the IP
// alone, and the IP half is the RESOLVED client IP rather than the TCP peer.
//
// Both halves matter and they pull in opposite directions, which is why they are tested
// together rather than as two properties of one key function:
//
//   - Without the workspace, two tenants' bookers behind one address — a shared office,
//     a corporate NAT, a CDN — share a bucket, so the busier workspace spends the
//     quieter one's allowance. One tenant degrades another's service through no fault
//     of either.
//   - Without TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS the "IP" behind a proxy is the proxy, so adding the
//     workspace prefix would make things WORSE: a whole tenant would become a single
//     bucket and its first N bookers a minute would exhaust it for everyone else in
//     that tenant. The workspace half is only safe because remoteIP resolves the
//     client's own address when a trusted hop forwarded it.
//
// The limiter runs before any handler, so the workspace comes from the request Host and
// not from a resolved *Workspace: rejecting a request must not cost a database read.

// limiterProbe drives one request through TrustClientIP + RateLimit and reports the
// status. The limit is 1 per minute so the second request against the same bucket is a
// 429 and nothing depends on timing.
