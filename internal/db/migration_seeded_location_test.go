// Migration 00065 repairs the event types provisioning seeded as 'link' with no value —
// a state validateLocation rejects, so the tenant's first save from the editor failed on
// a field they had never touched. The seed fix stops new rows arriving in it; this is the
// rows already there.
//
// ⚠️ Both engines. The migration is a plain UPDATE with nothing dialect-specific in it,
// which is exactly the kind of file that gets written once and copied — so it is asserted
// on whichever engine dbtest selects rather than on SQLite alone, and CI runs both.

// replayMigrations re-applies one migration by forgetting it, so a data migration
// can be exercised against rows that were not there when the test database was built.
//
// dbtest hands back a database already at the target version, and 00065's whole subject is
// rows that predate it. Deleting its goose_db_version row and migrating again runs the
// real file, from the real embedded FS, through the boot path's goose setup —
// rather than a copy of its SQL pasted into a test, which would assert that the test is
// self-consistent and nothing about the migration that ships. It allows the forgotten
// version to be "missing" below later ones: 00065 stopped being the newest migration when
// 00066-00068 arrived with the upstream merge, and plain Migrate refuses that gap.
