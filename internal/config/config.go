	// sessions, so it belongs with the platform secrets rather than in a settings
	// page an admin session can reach.

	// MetricsToken is the bearer token that authorises GET /metrics. Empty ⇒ that

	// MetricsAllowUnauthenticatedFrom lists the networks whose requests may scrape
	// GET /metrics with no bearer at all. Empty (the default) ⇒ the bearer is the only
	// way in, which is what every existing deployment has.
	//
	// It exists because a Prometheus scraper is not a caller that can hold a secret in
	// the shape this endpoint wants one. Grafana Alloy's annotation autodiscovery sends
	// ONE bearer token file for every target it scrapes, so pointing it at METRICS_TOKEN
	// would present this instance's token to every other annotation-scraped pod on the

	//
	// ⛔ It is matched against the TCP PEER, never a forwarded header — see
	// handler.SetMetricsAnonymousNetworks. A CIDR list checked against a value the client
	// chooses is not a control at all, and this one is the whole control.
	//
	// Comma-separated CIDRs; a bare address is taken as a single host, exactly as

	// STTBaseURL overrides the speech-to-text endpoint host for the notetaker, e.g. a

	CookieSecure bool

	// EmbedAllowedOrigins lists the origins permitted to call the public booking
	// endpoints cross-origin (for the embeddable widget). Empty ⇒ allow any origin
	// (`*`). CORS only constrains browsers; it is not an access-control boundary —
	// the public endpoints are rate-limited regardless. Comma-separated.
	EmbedAllowedOrigins []string

	// TrustedProxyCIDRs lists the networks whose forwarded headers are believed when
	// resolving the client IP for per-IP rate limiting. Empty (the default) ⇒ the limit
	// keys on the TCP peer and X-Forwarded-For is ignored entirely, because a header
	// from an unvetted peer is a client-chosen value. Comma-separated CIDRs; a bare
	// address is taken as a single host. A fronting CDN's own ranges belong here: the
	// walk steps over its edge address and lands on the visitor.
	TrustedProxyCIDRs []string

	// FrameAncestors lists the origins allowed to embed the admin SPA in a frame, as a
	// Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestors source list. Space-separated, matching the
	// CSP syntax it becomes. Empty (the default) ⇒ nothing is sent and /admin/ behaves
	// exactly as it did. Each entry must be `https://host[:port]` or `'self'`; anything
	// else fails Validate and the process refuses to start, because a directive the
	// browser cannot parse is a directive that silently allows everything.
	//
	// Only the admin SPA is affected. The public booking pages keep their
	// `frame-ancestors 'none'` + `X-Frame-Options: DENY` unconditionally — those are
	// unauthenticated pages that take payment details, and no operator convenience is
	// worth making them embeddable.
	//
	// ⛔ Permitting the frame is not the same as making it work, and this setting is only
	// the first half. calnode_session is SameSite=Lax, so a browser withholds it from a
	// subresource request made by a CROSS-SITE parent: an operator who lists a console on
	// an unrelated registrable domain gets the frame they asked for and a login screen
	// inside it, with nothing in the response explaining why. Same-site parents ('self',
	// or a host under BASE_URL's registrable domain) are the working case. The fix would
	// be SameSite=None on the session cookie, which withdraws the CSRF protection Lax
	// gives every other route, so it is not on offer here.
	//
	// In multi-tenant mode the console and its cookie live on each workspace's
	// public_host rather than on BASE_URL, so "same-site" is measured against that host.
	FrameAncestors []string

	// PlatformReturnOrigins lists the origins a platform console may ask an OAuth round
	// trip to come back to. Comma-separated absolute origins (`scheme://host[:port]`,
	// no path, query or fragment). Empty (the default) ⇒ the feature is off and
	// `?return_to=` is refused rather than ignored, so a platform that sends one against
	// an instance that was never configured for it hears about it at the first attempt.
	//
	// It exists because a platform embedding this scheduler wants the person back on ITS
	// page after connecting a calendar, and the callback otherwise lands on the operator's
	// own console. The value is carried inside the ENCRYPTED OAuth state, so what the
	// callback redirects to was chosen at connect time by an authenticated user and
	// checked against this list then; nothing on the callback URL can steer it.
	//
	// The security rule is the same one FrameAncestors states: an entry must be
	// `https://host[:port]` (plain http only for localhost/127.0.0.1, for a developer
	// running both halves on a laptop), never a wildcard, and the match at connect time is
	// the WHOLE origin, byte for byte. A prefix match would accept
	// `https://console.example.com.evil.test`, and an open redirect out of an OAuth
	// callback is worth more to an attacker than most bugs in this file.
	PlatformReturnOrigins []string

	// DemoMode turns this instance into a public, self-resetting demo: seeds sample
